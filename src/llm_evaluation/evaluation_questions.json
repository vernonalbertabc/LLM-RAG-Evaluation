      "Regarding the dividends, the percentage that we chose in the range of 20% to 30% once again is a very high percentage. So it is in the upper end of the upper half of the range and the difference to the payout ratio in last year is only in the decimals. So therefore, we see that this is actually a signal of strength, a signal of confidence that we",
      "have, that in spite of many challenges that we see in the economic environment, we are rewarding our shareholders as we promised and keep the payout ratio at the upper end of the range. When it comes to the increase of the regular dividend with our progressive dividend policy, again, we kept our promise to increase. And we increased that by EUR 0.10. And again, this is not much different than last year. If you put it in percentages, yes, it's slightly lower, but that has a reason. The reason actually is that, of course, the higher you get, the more important it is to also keep a certain balance between the additional variable dividend and the regular dividend.",
      "The clean operating results of Energy segment declined by EUR 142 million to EUR 910 million as a better E&P result could not compensate for the lower gas marketing and power contribution. The performance of E&P improved, driven by positive market effects of around EUR 14 million. Gas prices rose significantly compared with the first quarter of 2024, while oil prices decreased.",
      "At around EUR 1.4 billion cash flow from operating activities was strong, rising by 32% compared with the previous quarter. However, it was 26% below the very strong first quarter of last year, which had benefited from a higher result and higher dividends from ADNOC Refining. Net working capital effects were around neutral. The organic cash flow from investing activities was around EUR 1 billion, mainly related to ordinary ongoing business investments and major growth projects such as",

         "answer": "OMV's Q4 2025 financial results and key performance indicators (KPIs) are summarized below based on the provided data: Financial Performance Highlights (Q4 2025): Clean CCS Operating Result: ~EUR 1.2 billion, down 22% YoY (vs. Q4 2024) and 16% QoQ (vs. Q3 2025). Decline mainly due to the absence of arbitration-related gains in gas marketing/power seen in Q4 2024. Clean CCS EPS: EUR 1.26. Cash Flow from Operating Activities: ~EUR 1.4 billion, up 30%+ from Q3 2025, indicating strong cash generation despite lower production. Key Operational KPIs: Polyolefin Sales Volumes (including JVs): up 10% YoY. Fuel Sales Volumes: Remained broadly stable. Hydrocarbon Production: down 12% YoY due to Malaysian asset divestment. European Crackers Utilization Rate: up 3 percentage points to 90%. Base Chemicals Business declined due to lower inventory valuation effects, decreased stock advantage, and higher customer discounts. Polyolefins Segment lower performance from higher fixed costs and lower realized margins. Dividend & Capital Structure: Regular Dividend Increased by EUR 0.10, continuing the progressive dividend policy. Payout ratio remains in the 20%–30% range, near the upper end, reflecting confidence and commitment to shareholder returns. Net Debt & Leverage: Leverage ratio well below 30% (specifically noted as 12% at the end of Q1 2025). Cash Position (as of end-Q1 2025): EUR 6.5 billion. Undrawn Credit Facilities: EUR 4.2 billion. Investment & Strategic Moves: Organic free cash flow before dividends (Q1 2025): EUR 441 million. Ongoing major investments: NextonDeep, PDH plant (Belgium), sorting plant (Germany). Divestments: Malaysian assets (impacted hydrocarbon production). Future Outlook: Expect polyolefin volumes to reach ~4.1 million tonnes in 2025 (excluding JVs). Tariff impacts on chemical markets still uncertain."

      "Before I will go into the details of the first quarter financial results, let me give you a short update on OMV's strategic progress. At the beginning of March, we reached a major milestone in the implementation of our Strategy 2030. OMV and ADNOC have signed a binding agreement to combine Borealis and Borouge along with the simultaneous acquisition of Nova Chemicals to form a new company Group International.",
      "Let me now return to the performance of our business segments in the first quarter of this year. Compared to the first quarter of 2024, the clean operating result of chemicals was almost flat at EUR 126 million. In our European business, we recorded positive market effects of EUR 57 million attributable mostly to rising olefin indicator margins.",
      "Inventory effects were positive but EUR 11 million lower compared to the first quarter of 2024. The utilization rate of our European crackers increased by 3 percentage points to 90%. The contribution of Borealis excluding joint ventures, declined to EUR 71 million. The base chemicals business decreased considerably as higher olefin indicator margins were more than offset by lower inventory valuation effects, a decreased like stock advantage and higher customer discounts. Polyolefins came in lower",
      "as well, mainly as a result of higher fixed costs and lower realized margins.",
      "We were able to expand polyolefin sales volumes, excluding joint ventures by 11%. Sales volumes in the consumer products and infrastructure industries increased as more demand was captured, while sales volumes in the mobility industry declined in line with the market sentiment. The contribution of the joint ventures grew to EUR 45 million, mainly due to better Borouge performance and the exclusion of Baystar's result from the clean operating result effective of March",
      "Overall, the result was positively impacted by around EUR 40 million due to a reclassification of Borealis as an asset held for sale following the signing of the transaction on March 3 to combine the shareholdings of Borealis and Borouge into Borouge Group International."
    ],
    "answer": "OMV's chemicals business in the first quarter of 2025 showed broadly stable performance compared to the same period in 2024, with some positive operational and market developments, but also challenges impacting profitability. Performance highlights: Clean Operating Result was €126 million — almost flat compared to Q1 2024. European Business benefited from positive market effects (€57 million), primarily due to rising olefin indicator margins. Inventory effects were still positive, but €11 million lower year-over-year. Cracker utilization rate improved from 87% to 90%. Borealis (excluding JVs) contribution declined to €71 million, impacted by lower inventory valuation effects, decreased like stock advantage, higher customer discounts, higher fixed costs and lower realized polyolefin margins. Polyolefins sales volumes (excluding JVs) increased by 11%. Growth was driven by consumer products and infrastructure, while mobility segment declined in line with market conditions. Joint Ventures (e.g., Borouge) contribution increased to €45 million, thanks to higher Borouge sales volumes and exclusion of Baystar's result starting in March. This was partially offset by lower polyethylene prices in Asia. Reclassification Gain: One-time positive impact of ~€40 million from reclassifying Borealis as an asset held for sale, following the March 3 agreement to combine Borealis and Borouge shareholdings into Borouge Group International."

    "question": "How did Ukraine's war impact OMV's business? Has there a been gradual decline in perfromance of any of divisions over the multiple quarters?",

Net debt was stable and our leverage ratio stayed low at 12%. At the end of March, OMV had a cash position of EUR 6.5 billion and EUR 4.2 billion in undrawn committed credit facilities. Looking ahead, we anticipate that volatility will persist, driven by uncertainties surrounding the outcome of ongoing tariff discussions and the Ukraine peace", 
      "talks, which significantly limit our visibility. We do not expect to be directly impacted by the import tariffs and our operations are less export oriented. We primarily produce and sell regionally. However, tariffs will influence the global economic environment and this will, in turn, have an impact on OMV.",
      "The ADNOC refining performance was clearly deteriorating as the local refining margins have dropped. The reason", 
      "are the crowded export markets in the refining business. We see, on the one hand side, more pressure from Chinese refineries, while the domestic market, specifically when it comes to vehicles, has been conquered at a quite significant pace with electric vehicles. And therefore, fuels are being increasingly exported. On the other side, countries outside of Russia, are processing Russian crude in refineries. And the ban that we see in Europe did not", 
      "really hold. Therefore, there is also competition from Russian products through refineries in India, in Turkey, in Pakistan, etc."      
    ],
    "answer": "1. Increased Market Volatility and Uncertainty: Peace talks in Ukraine are cited as a source of ongoing uncertainty that limits OMV's visibility into future performance. OMV acknowledges that even though they may not be directly impacted by import tariffs, the global economic ripple effects caused by geopolitical instability—such as the war in Ukraine—are influencing their operations. 2. Pressure on Refining Margins (ADNOC Division): The ADNOC refining division appears to be experiencing a gradual deterioration in performance. Key contributing factors include: Drop in local refining margins, due in part to: Crowded export markets, increased competition from Chinese refineries, electric vehicle adoption reducing domestic fuel demand, and Russian crude being processed in non-EU countries (India, Turkey, Pakistan), circumventing the European ban and re-entering the global supply, increasing competition and downward pressure on margins. This clearly indicates a gradual decline in the ADNOC refining segment over multiple quarters, exacerbated by shifts in global supply chains due to the Ukraine conflict. 3. Diversified Gas Portfolio Shift: OMV's gas supply and trading business moved from reliance on Russian gas arbitrage to a more diversified portfolio. They indicate that margins from this diversified approach may actually be better than those from earlier reliance on Russian gas. This suggests a strategic pivot rather than performance degradation, though it was prompted by disruptions following the Ukraine invasion. 4. Financial Resilience Despite Challenges: Despite the geopolitical and market pressures, OMV reports organic free cash flow of EUR 441 million in Q1 2025. Net debt remained stable, and leverage is low (12%). OMV holds a strong liquidity position (EUR 6.5B cash, EUR 4.2B undrawn facilities). This implies that while certain divisions like refining are struggling, the company as a whole has maintained financial strength, helped in part by its regional business focus and diversification strategy."
