They have a robust cash position of EUR 6.5 billion and access to EUR 4.2 billion in undrawn committed credit facilities. Furthermore, despite anticipating an increase in leverage due to the Borouge transaction, OMV is confident that their overall leverage will only rise slightly above 20%, remaining well within their target of 30%. This solid financial foundation indicates OMV's capability to manage its debt effectively while continuing to support its growth initiatives.",

I'll address your second question first and then hand over the first question for further elaboration. Concerning our balance sheet and the anticipated increase in leverage due to the Borouge transaction, we remain very confident in OMV's strong financial position. Importantly, we believe there is no need for us to divest any business assets, as we have already streamlined our portfolio effectively. Additionally, the extra leverage from the equity injection into BGI will be limited to approximately EUR 1.5 billion, which is well within our leverage target of 30%. We estimate that even with this increase, our leverage rate will rise only slightly above 20%. Therefore, at this time, we are not contemplating any major divestments, although periodic evaluations of our portfolio are a standard practice.\nactual_chunk: Reinhard Florey\n\nYes. Thanks, Alejandro. Maybe I'll start with the second question and pass on to for the first question to answer.

In addition to these benefits, OMV will maintain its investment-grade credit rating and keep its leverage ratio well below 30%, ensuring financial stability amidst expansion. The combined strength of the three companies involved will position Borouge Group International favorably, enabling it to generate attractive shareholder returns. As a result, we expect a lower dividend net to OMV of around $1 billion per year, which will further strengthen OMV's shareholder distributions.

        "title = omv_transcript_2025Q1\n\n recontextualized_answer: The significant cash injection of 1.6 billion into the new OMV will not only establish a 36.9% stake in Borouge Group International\u2014sharing equal ownership and joint control with ADNOC\u2014but will also harness substantial growth potential in the polyolefins sector. Borouge Group International is set to become a formidable platform for organic growth, bolstered by a solid pipeline of upcoming projects. As we project EBITDA to exceed USD 7 billion, we also foresee substantial synergies of approximately $500 million per annum on a run rate basis by 2030. These synergies will play a crucial role in creating immediate value for OMV, which benefits from free cash flow and clean CCS EPS accretion while maintaining its investment-grade credit rating and ensuring its leverage ratio remains well below 30%.

Decline mainly due to the absence of arbitration-related gains in gas marketing/power seen in Q4 2024. Clean CCS EPS: EUR 1.26. Cash Flow from Operating Activities: ~EUR 1.4 billion, up 30%+ from Q3 2025, indicating strong cash generation despite lower production. Key Operational KPIs: Polyolefin Sales Volumes (including JVs): up 10% YoY. Fuel Sales Volumes: Remained broadly stable. Hydrocarbon Production: down 12% YoY due to Malaysian asset divestment. European Crackers Utilization Rate: up 3 percentage points to 90%. Base Chemicals Business declined due to lower inventory valuation effects, decreased stock advantage, and higher customer discounts. Polyolefins Segment lower performance from higher fixed costs and lower realized margins. Dividend & Capital Structure: Regular Dividend Increased by EUR 0.10, continuing the progressive dividend policy. Payout ratio remains in the 20%\u201330% range, near the upper end, reflecting confidence and commitment to shareholder returns.

And again, this is not much different than last year. If you put it in percentages, yes, it's slightly lower, but that has a reason.

Among the topics discussed were margins, capital expenditures (CAPEX), and operational metrics such as utilization rates and inventory effects.\n\n**Margins and CAPEX Discussion:**\nA notable point of discussion was the company's refining margins, which are essential for assessing profitability in the context of fluctuating market conditions. The panel also highlighted the company's ongoing commitment to managing CAPEX effectively to support growth while ensuring that operational efficiencies are maintained.\n\n**Operational Efficiencies:**\nUtilization rates and inventory effects were addressed, underscoring the company's operational strategy to optimize production and inventory levels. In alignment with this, strategic projects like Borouge and Baystar were mentioned, as they play significant roles in enhancing market presence and leveraging demand in key sectors.\n\n**Future Outlook:**\nAs the dialogue transitioned into segments concerning renewable fuels and energy management, the emphasis was placed on gas supply and storage, particularly in Eastern Europe. Notably, the company is navigating a complex macro environment while aiming for growth in low-carbon initiatives.\n\n**Dividend Strategy:**\nIn response to a question by Sasikanth Chilukuru from Morgan Stanley regarding dividend payouts relative to cash flow from operations (CFFO), it was pointed out that this year's payout is set at 28%, a slight decrease from last year's 29%. This prompted further inquiries into the factors influencing this decision. Chilukuru noted that at a 30% CFFO payout, OMV could have potentially maintained flat dividends year-on-year. He also referenced a year-on-year growth rate of the regular dividend, which has decreased to 3.5% this year compared to 5% last year. This raised pertinent questions about the implications of the slowed growth rate under current circumstances and whether this is a sustainable trend moving forward. \n\nIn summary, the discussion covered crucial aspects of OMV\u2019s financial strategies and operational performance, providing investors with a comprehensive overview of the company\u2019s positioning in a challenging market landscape while addressing specific stakeholder concerns about dividends and growth trajectories.\nactual_chunk: Margins 3\nCAPEX 3\nUtilization rates 4\nInventory effects 4\nBorouge 4 4\nBaystar 5\nFuels & Feedstock 5\nRefining margins 5\nRenewable fuels 5\nEnergy 6\nGas supply 6\nGas storage 6\nGas & Power\nEastern Europe 7\nLow Carbon 7\nOMV Group\nDividend\nQuestion by Sasikanth Chilukuru \u2013 Morgan Stanley:\nHow do you decide upon the dividend payout relative to CFFO?

Notable positive market impacts were seen, particularly from rising olefin indicator margins, contributing EUR 57 million to the European segment. However, the specialized chemicals market did experience a setback, with a decline in market share, emphasizing the need for strategic adjustments.\n\nTo bolster profitability, OMV secured an EUR 81 million grant from the European Union to enhance its chemical recycling initiatives and is exploring opportunities to shift toward higher-grade chemical products, which have historically improved profit margins.

European Business benefited from positive market effects (\u20ac57 million), primarily due to rising olefin indicator margins. Inventory effects were still positive, but \u20ac11 million lower year-over-year. Cracker utilization rate improved from 87% to 90%. Borealis (excluding JVs) contribution declined to \u20ac71 million, impacted by lower inventory valuation effects, decreased like stock advantage, higher customer discounts, higher fixed costs and lower realized polyolefin margins. Polyolefins sales volumes (excluding JVs) increased by 11%. Growth was driven by consumer products and infrastructure, while mobility segment declined in line with market conditions. Joint Ventures (e.g., Borouge) contribution increased to \u20ac45 million, thanks to higher Borouge sales volumes and exclusion of Baystar's result starting in March. This was partially offset by lower polyethylene prices in Asia.

In the Chemicals sector, we are actively exploring opportunities to shift our portfolio towards higher grading, which historically has unlocked avenues for improved margins. However, in Q1, we experienced a decline in our share of the specialized chemicals market, which is something we are determined to reverse throughout the remainder of the year. \n\nMoreover, if we observe a certain recovery in the economy and a positive trend in the pricing of pre-materials and feedstock for chemicals, this could lead to a margin uplift that we aim to capitalize on in the market. This potential for recovery is not just optimistic; it aligns with our strategy to enhance margins and regain our competitive position in the specialties. \n\nAdding to this, the resilience of our integrated business model is crucial as we navigate these fluctuations.

Compared to the first quarter of 2024, the clean operating result of chemicals was almost flat at EUR 126 million. In our European business, we recorded positive market effects of EUR 57 million attributable mostly to rising olefin indicator margins. However, inventory effects were positive yet EUR 11 million lower compared to the previous year. Notably, the utilization rate of our European crackers saw an improvement, increasing by 3 percentage points to 90%. Despite these gains, the contribution of Borealis, excluding joint ventures, declined to EUR 71 million. The base chemicals business faced considerable challenges, as the benefits of higher olefin indicator margins were more than offset by lower inventory valuation effects, a decreased like stock advantage, and higher customer discounts. Consequently, polyolefins also came in lower, primarily driven by rising fixed costs and diminishing realized margins.\nactual_chunk: Inventory effects were positive but EUR 11 million lower compared to the first quarter of 2024.

Specifically, I would like to confirm whether the full dividend amount\u2014or at least the portion corresponding to OMV\u2014is based on 90% of net income, or if it relates to the EUR 2.2 billion total, which translates to USD 1 billion allocated to OMV. This clarification on the BGI dividend is quite important to me.\"\n\nFollowing this inquiry, I would also like to discuss the current state of chemicals margins. In light of the recent market environment, there seem to be some emerging opportunities. I noticed that you mentioned improvements in certain chemical spreads in April. Could you elaborate on the key drivers behind these trends? Understanding these factors will help us assess the sustainability of the improvements moving forward. \n\nReinhard Florey, I'm eager to hear your insights on this matter.\nactual_chunk: We now come to Matt Smith, Bank of America.\n\nMatt Smith\n\nTwo questions from me, please. The first is just a clarification on the Borouge Group International floor dividend, and that was just a simple clarification whether the full dividend or at least to OMV was the -- whether it was 90% of net income, whether that represents the floor or whether it was the EUR 2.2 billion total amount that translated to USD 1 billion to OMV. So that was a simple clarification on the BGI dividend?",
        "title = omv_transcript_2025Q1\n\n recontextualized_answer: Our polyolefin sales volumes, including joint ventures, grew by 10% year-on-year. Fuel sales volumes remained broadly stable, while hydrocarbon production decreased by 12% year-on-year, impacted primarily by the divestment of our Malaysian assets. Cash flow from operating activities reached nearly EUR 1.4 billion, reflecting a more than 30% increase compared to the previous quarter. \n\nIn this context, the Clean CCS operating result stood strong at around EUR 1.2 billion. However, this figure represents a decline of 22% from the same quarter last year and is 16% lower than the fourth quarter of 2024, which had seen significant benefits from arbitration outcomes in gas marketing and power sectors. Notably, Clean CCS earnings per share were reported at EUR 1.26.\n\nLooking ahead, before delving into the first quarter financial details, I want to highlight OMV's strategic progress. In early March, we reached a significant milestone in executing our Strategy 2030. OMV and ADNOC have signed a binding agreement to merge Borealis and Borouge, coupled with the acquisition of Nova Chemicals, to establish a new company named Group International. This strategic alliance with ADNOC in polyolefins is expected to yield substantial benefits for OMV.\nactual_chunk: Clean CCS operating result was solid, coming in at around EUR 1.2 billion, 22% below the prior year quarter level and 16% lower than the fourth quarter of 2024, which have benefited significantly from the arbitration world in gas marketing in power. Clean CCS earnings per share amounted to EUR 1.26."

      "question": "How did Ukraine's war impact OMV's business? Has there a been gradual decline in perfromance of any of divisions over the multiple quarters?",
      "generated_answer": "The war in Ukraine has introduced significant uncertainties for OMV, particularly affecting its visibility into future operations and financial performance. Although OMV does not anticipate a direct impact from import tariffs due to its regional focus, the broader implications of the geopolitical climate can influence market dynamics. OMV has faced production challenges and a decline in the clean operating results of its Energy segment, which dropped by EUR 142 million to a total of EUR 910 million. This decline was driven by recent factors such as production issues, notably a fall in production volumes by 42,000 barrels per day, and a marked decline in gas marketing and power contributions, which saw a reduction of EUR 102 million. Over multiple quarters, the downward trend in the performance of certain divisions, particularly in gas marketing, indicates a gradual decline correlated with external pressures stemming from legislative changes and market volatility.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "1. Increased Market Volatility and Uncertainty: Peace talks in Ukraine are cited as a source of ongoing uncertainty that limits OMV's visibility into future performance. OMV acknowledges that even though they may not be directly impacted by import tariffs, the global economic ripple effects caused by geopolitical instability\u2014such as the war in Ukraine\u2014are influencing their operations. 2. Pressure on Refining Margins (ADNOC Division): The ADNOC refining division appears to be experiencing a gradual deterioration in performance. Key contributing factors include: Drop in local refining margins, due in part to: Crowded export markets, increased competition from Chinese refineries, electric vehicle adoption reducing domestic fuel demand, and Russian crude being processed in non-EU countries (India, Turkey, Pakistan), circumventing the European ban and re-entering the global supply, increasing competition and downward pressure on margins. This clearly indicates a gradual decline in the ADNOC refining segment over multiple quarters, exacerbated by shifts in global supply chains due to the Ukraine conflict. 3. Diversified Gas Portfolio Shift: OMV's gas supply and trading business moved from reliance on Russian gas arbitrage to a more diversified portfolio. They indicate that margins from this diversified approach may actually be better than those from earlier reliance on Russian gas. This suggests a strategic pivot rather than performance degradation, though it was prompted by disruptions following the Ukraine invasion. 4. Financial Resilience Despite Challenges: Despite the geopolitical and market pressures, OMV reports organic free cash flow of EUR 441 million in Q1 2025. Net debt remained stable, and leverage is low (12%). OMV holds a strong liquidity position (EUR 6.5B cash, EUR 4.2B undrawn facilities). This implies that while certain divisions like refining are struggling, the company as a whole has maintained financial strength, helped in part by its regional business focus and diversification strategy.",

        "The ADNOC refining performance was clearly deteriorating as the local refining margins have dropped. The reason",
        "are the crowded export markets in the refining business. We see, on the one hand side, more pressure from Chinese refineries, while the domestic market, specifically when it comes to vehicles, has been conquered at a quite significant pace with electric vehicles. And therefore, fuels are being increasingly exported. On the other side, countries outside of Russia, are processing Russian crude in refineries. And the ban that we see in Europe did not",

While the exploration and production (E&P) sector showed improved performance with a positive market effect of around EUR 14 million, it was overshadowed by a decline in gas marketing and power contributions. Specifically, production volumes fell by 42,000 barrels per day, primarily due to the divestment of Malaysian assets and the natural decline of production in Norway and New Zealand. This decline in production was only partially mitigated by increased output in the media sector. Accompanying this drop in production volumes, production costs slightly increased to $10.1 per barrel. Sales volumes mirrored the downturn in production and were further affected by the lifting schedule in Norway. The significant decline in gas marketing and power results worsened the situation, showing a sharp decrease of EUR 102 million, highlighting reductions observed in both eastern and western markets. \n\nFollowing this, the gas waste result amounted to EUR 120 million, largely propelled by lower storage results due to reduced summer spreads, but was somewhat balanced by an arbitration award of approximately EUR 50 million related to the Austrian supply contract.
