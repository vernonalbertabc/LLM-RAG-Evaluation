      "question": "What is OMV's current debt level and financial leverage position in 2025?",
      "generated_answer": "As of the first quarter of 2025, OMV maintains a strong balance sheet characterized by stable net debt and a low leverage ratio of 12%. The company reported a significant cash position of EUR 6.5 billion, alongside EUR 4.2 billion in undrawn committed credit facilities, which provides a robust cushion against financial obligations. Given these metrics, OMV demonstrates a strong financial health despite potential increases in leverage due to the Borouge transaction, which has raised concerns about future debt levels. However, OMV's management has expressed confidence in its ability to manage this increased leverage and maintain strong credit ratings without the immediate need for divestments. These factors indicate a resilient financial position in a potentially volatile economic environment.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "OMV's net debt was stable and their leverage ratio stayed low at 12%. At the end of March 2025, OMV had a cash position of EUR 6.5 billion and EUR 4.2 billion in undrawn committed credit facilities.",

        "As a result, the organic free cash flow before dividends for the first quarter of 2025 came in at EUR 441 million. Our balance sheet remained very strong.

Net debt was stable and our leverage ratio stayed low at 12%. At the end of March, OMV had a cash position of EUR 6.5 billion and EUR 4.2 billion in undrawn committed credit facilities. Looking ahead, we anticipate that volatility will persist, driven by uncertainties surrounding the outcome of ongoing tariff discussions and the Ukraine peace talks, which significantly limit our visibility. We do not expect to be directly impacted by the import tariffs and our operations are less export oriented. We primarily produce and sell regionally. However, tariffs will influence the global economic environment and this will, in turn, have an impact on OMV.",
        "And the second question is about -- of course, you have a very strong balance sheet, but you're going to increase also leverage with the transaction of Borouge If you are planning some divestments as part of your plan for the coming years to offset this increase in leverage.\n\nReinhard Florey\n\nYes. Thanks, Alejandro. Maybe I'll start with the second question and pass on to for the first question to answer. Regarding the balance sheet and regarding the leverage -- we are still very confident and see a very strong position of OMV. There is no need for us to divest a business as we have already streamlined our portfolio.",

Our sales volumes at Borealis, including the sales from joint ventures, will go up by\nanother 200 kt to 4.1 mn t.

The first is just a clarification on the Borouge Group International floor dividend, and that was just a simple clarification whether the full dividend or at least to OMV was the -- whether it was 90% of net income, whether that represents the floor or whether it was the EUR 2.2 billion total amount that translated to USD 1 billion to OMV. So that was a simple clarification on the BGI dividend?\n\nAnd then secondly, I wanted to come on to the chemicals margins not sort of current and certain environment actually thrown up some opportunities.

The organic free cash flow before dividends for Q1 2025 was reported at EUR 441 million, indicating strong cash generation. OMV maintained a robust balance sheet, with net debt stability and a low leverage ratio of 12%. The company held a cash position of EUR 6.5 billion and had EUR 4.2 billion in undrawn committed credit facilities. Despite challenges in visibility due to geopolitical factors and uncertainties regarding global economics, OMV's operations remained resilient, allowing for continued dividend payouts and investment in strategic partnerships, such as the agreement with ADNOC to combine Borealis and Borouge.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "OMV's Q4 2025 financial results and key performance indicators (KPIs) are summarized below based on the provided data: Financial Performance Highlights (Q4 2025): Clean CCS Operating Result: ~EUR 1.2 billion, down 22% YoY (vs. Q4 2024) and 16% QoQ (vs. Q3 2025). Decline mainly due to the absence of arbitration-related gains in gas marketing/power seen in Q4 2024. Clean CCS EPS: EUR 1.26. Cash Flow from Operating Activities: ~EUR 1.4 billion, up 30%+ from Q3 2025, indicating strong cash generation despite lower production. Key Operational KPIs: Polyolefin Sales Volumes (including JVs): up 10% YoY. Fuel Sales Volumes: Remained broadly stable. Hydrocarbon Production: down 12% YoY due to Malaysian asset divestment. European Crackers Utilization Rate: up 3 percentage points to 90%. Base Chemicals Business declined due to lower inventory valuation effects, decreased stock advantage, and higher customer discounts. Polyolefins Segment lower performance from higher fixed costs and lower realized margins. Dividend & Capital Structure: Regular Dividend Increased by EUR 0.10, continuing the progressive dividend policy. Payout ratio remains in the 20%\u201330% range, near the upper end, reflecting confidence and commitment to shareholder returns. Net Debt & Leverage: Leverage ratio well below 30% (specifically noted as 12% at the end of Q1 2025). Cash Position (as of end-Q1 2025): EUR 6.5 billion. Undrawn Credit Facilities: EUR 4.2 billion. Investment & Strategic Moves: Organic free cash flow before dividends (Q1 2025): EUR 441 million. Ongoing major investments: NextonDeep, PDH plant (Belgium), sorting plant (Germany). Divestments: Malaysian assets (impacted hydrocarbon production). Future Outlook: Expect polyolefin volumes to reach ~4.1 million tonnes in 2025 (excluding JVs). Tariff impacts on chemical markets still uncertain.",

        "Regarding the dividends, the percentage that we chose in the range of 20% to 30% once again is a very high percentage. So it is in the upper end of the upper half of the range and the difference to the payout ratio in last year is only in the decimals. So therefore, we see that this is actually a signal of strength, a signal of confidence that we",
        "have, that in spite of many challenges that we see in the economic environment, we are rewarding our shareholders as we promised and keep the payout ratio at the upper end of the range. When it comes to the increase of the regular dividend with our progressive dividend policy, again, we kept our promise to increase. And we increased that by EUR 0.10. And again, this is not much different than last year. If you put it in percentages, yes, it's slightly lower, but that has a reason. The reason actually is that, of course, the higher you get, the more important it is to also keep a certain balance between the additional variable dividend and the regular dividend.",
        "The clean operating results of Energy segment declined by EUR 142 million to EUR 910 million as a better E&P result could not compensate for the lower gas marketing and power contribution. The performance of E&P improved, driven by positive market effects of around EUR 14 million. Gas prices rose significantly compared with the first quarter of 2024, while oil prices decreased.",
        "At around EUR 1.4 billion cash flow from operating activities was strong, rising by 32% compared with the previous quarter. However, it was 26% below the very strong first quarter of last year, which had benefited from a higher result and higher dividends from ADNOC Refining. Net working capital effects were around neutral. The organic cash flow from investing activities was around EUR 1 billion, mainly related to ordinary ongoing business investments and major growth projects such as",

      "question": "How was the performance of OMV's chemicals business? Were there any new investments for profitability?",
      "generated_answer": "OMV's chemicals business demonstrated resilience, with operational cash flow reported at EUR 900 million, reflecting robust performance in a challenging market environment. The company is focused on enhancing profitability through strategic adjustments, such as shifting the product portfolio toward higher-grade materials, which unlock opportunities for improved margins. Despite facing a decline in specialty product share in early 2025, OMV aims to increase this share throughout the year.\n\nFurthermore, OMV anticipates that a recovery in the broader economy and favorable pricing for chemical feedstock will contribute to margin uplift. The strategic moves, such as the planned acquisition of Nova Chemicals, signify OMV's commitment to expanding its chemical operations while maintaining operational efficiency. New investments are likely directed toward optimizing production and enhancing product offerings, suggesting an ongoing focus on profitability within its chemicals segment.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "OMV's chemicals business in the first quarter of 2025 showed broadly stable performance compared to the same period in 2024, with some positive operational and market developments, but also challenges impacting profitability. Performance highlights: Clean Operating Result was \u20ac126 million \u2014 almost flat compared to Q1 2024. European Business benefited from positive market effects (\u20ac57 million), primarily due to rising olefin indicator margins. Inventory effects were still positive, but \u20ac11 million lower year-over-year. Cracker utilization rate improved from 87% to 90%. Borealis (excluding JVs) contribution declined to \u20ac71 million, impacted by lower inventory valuation effects, decreased like stock advantage, higher customer discounts, higher fixed costs and lower realized polyolefin margins. Polyolefins sales volumes (excluding JVs) increased by 11%. Growth was driven by consumer products and infrastructure, while mobility segment declined in line with market conditions. Joint Ventures (e.g., Borouge) contribution increased to \u20ac45 million, thanks to higher Borouge sales volumes and exclusion of Baystar's result starting in March. This was partially offset by lower polyethylene prices in Asia. Reclassification Gain: One-time positive impact of ~\u20ac40 million from reclassifying Borealis as an asset held for sale, following the March 3 agreement to combine Borealis and Borouge shareholdings into Borouge Group International.",

The contribution of Borealis excluding joint ventures, declined to EUR 71 million. The base chemicals business decreased considerably as higher olefin indicator margins were more than offset by lower inventory valuation effects, a decreased like stock advantage and higher customer discounts. Polyolefins came in lower",

        "We were able to expand polyolefin sales volumes, excluding joint ventures by 11%. Sales volumes in the consumer products and infrastructure industries increased as more demand was captured, while sales volumes in the mobility industry declined in line with the market sentiment. The contribution of the joint ventures grew to EUR 45 million, mainly due to better Borouge performance and the exclusion of Baystar's result from the clean operating result effective of March",
        "Overall, the result was positively impacted by around EUR 40 million due to a reclassification of Borealis as an asset held for sale following the signing of the transaction on March 3 to combine the shareholdings of Borealis and Borouge into Borouge Group International."

Net debt was stable and our leverage ratio stayed low at 12%. At the end of March, OMV had a cash position of EUR 6.5 billion and EUR 4.2 billion in undrawn committed credit facilities. Looking ahead, we anticipate that volatility will persist, driven by uncertainties surrounding the outcome of ongoing tariff discussions and the Ukraine peace talks, which significantly limit our visibility. We do not expect to be directly impacted by the import tariffs and our operations are less export oriented. We primarily produce and sell regionally. However, tariffs will influence the global economic environment and this will, in turn, have an impact on OMV.",
        "And the second question is about -- of course, you have a very strong balance sheet, but you're going to increase also leverage with the transaction of Borouge If you are planning some divestments as part of your plan for the coming years to offset this increase in leverage.\n\nReinhard Florey\n\nYes. Thanks, Alejandro. Maybe I'll start with the second question and pass on to for the first question to answer. Regarding the balance sheet and regarding the leverage -- we are still very confident and see a very strong position of OMV. There is no need for us to divest a business as we have already streamlined our portfolio.",
        "Before I will go into the details of the first quarter financial results, let me give you a short update on OMV's strategic progress. At the beginning of March, we reached a major milestone in the implementation of our Strategy 2030. OMV and ADNOC have signed a binding agreement to combine Borealis and Borouge along with the simultaneous acquisition of Nova Chemicals to form a new company Group International. This strategic partnership with ADNOC in polyolefins will bring clear benefits to OMV and our shareholders.",
        "Florian Greger\n\nWe now come to Matt Smith, Bank of America.\n\nMatt Smith\n\nTwo questions from me, please. The first is just a clarification on the Borouge Group International floor dividend, and that was just a simple clarification whether the full dividend or at least to OMV was the -- whether it was 90% of net income, whether that represents the floor or whether it was the EUR 2.2 billion total amount that translated to USD 1 billion to OMV. So that was a simple clarification on the BGI dividend?\n\nAnd then secondly, I wanted to come on to the chemicals margins not sort of current and certain environment actually thrown up some opportunities. And I think you noted some improvements in some chemical spreads in April, but just wanted to I wondered if you could touch on some of the drivers there, please understand those opportunities. What do you think is driving that and therefore, help us think about the sustainability of that, please?\n\nReinhard Florey",

And with quite a\nfew new polyethylene projects starting up, particularly in China, I was just wondering if you can think there is supply\nside risk where you possibly see some further pressure on prices or margins for polyolefins.\nAnswer by Alfred Stern:\nFor 2025 we should at least be at the polyolefin margin level of last year, i.e. for both polyethylene and\npolypropylene above EUR 400/t. Our sales volumes at Borealis, including the sales from joint ventures, will go up by\nanother 200 kt to 4.1 mn t. As I highlighted in my speech, it's actually quite amazing that we were able to grow\nvolumes by 10% last year, which shows quite some recovery in addition to recovery of the margins in the market.",
        "So you would see as an operating cash flow, the EUR 900 million and as a free cash flow also the EUR 900 million. In Chemicals margins regarding opportunities, whenever we see the possibilities to shift the portfolio towards higher grading that always unlocks an opportunity for higher margins. Currently, we have seen in Q1, rather a decline of our share on the specialties. This is something we aim to reverse for the rest of the year to come back to a quite high share of specialties.\n\nAnd if we see a certain recovery of the economy, and also a positive pricing of the pre-materials of the feedstock for chemicals. This enables them also a margin uplift that we could realize in the market.\n\nMartijn Arjen van Koten",

        "Josh Stone\n\nI thought I'd keep going. On to about tariffs, you mentioned no direct impact or very minimal impact on OMV. Can you maybe just expand on Nova Chemicals and going through the scenarios on that, given they have both U.S. and Canadian assets, it's quite difficult for us to understand what potential impact that might be? And I'm sure you did a lot of audit on that. So maybe you could just talk about that, that would be helpful.\n\nReinhard Florey\n\nIndeed, in a general note, the exposure to tariffs as we see it in the narrow sense will be marginal to OMV. The reason simply is that with our supply radius that we have, both on the upstream side and the downstream side. We are not in a cross-continental trade or any cross continental business. On the other hand, when it comes to we are seeing that this global individual setup as such, will rather help to avoid being exposed to tariffs."

      "question": "How did Ukraine's war impact OMV's business? Has there a been gradual decline in perfromance of any of divisions over the multiple quarters?",
      "generated_answer": "The war in Ukraine has had significant implications for OMV's business operations, primarily through increased geopolitical volatility and uncertainty in the energy market. This uncertainty has affected supply chains and created an unpredictable environment for energy prices. The ongoing conflict has constrained visibility around future performance and operational consistency across divisions.  \n\nSpecifically, the gas segment faced challenges due to reliance on suppliers affected by the conflict. While OMV has diversified its gas supply sources to mitigate risks\u2014moving away from a dependence on traditional suppliers like Gazprom\u2014there have nonetheless been operational impacts. The company's decision to exit the Gazprom contract was driven by contractual violations, highlighting a shift in strategy amidst turbulent market conditions.  \n\nFurthermore, divisions such as gas marketing and power experienced sharp declines in revenue due to legislative changes, market dynamics, and decreased storage results caused by these geopolitical stresses. Overall, while OMV's performance may not have collapsed, a gradual decline in certain segments can be observed, necessitating strategic adjustments to ensure resilience amid ongoing challenges.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "1. Increased Market Volatility and Uncertainty: Peace talks in Ukraine are cited as a source of ongoing uncertainty that limits OMV's visibility into future performance. OMV acknowledges that even though they may not be directly impacted by import tariffs, the global economic ripple effects caused by geopolitical instability\u2014such as the war in Ukraine\u2014are influencing their operations. 2. Pressure on Refining Margins (ADNOC Division): The ADNOC refining division appears to be experiencing a gradual deterioration in performance. Key contributing factors include: Drop in local refining margins, due in part to: Crowded export markets, increased competition from Chinese refineries, electric vehicle adoption reducing domestic fuel demand, and Russian crude being processed in non-EU countries (India, Turkey, Pakistan), circumventing the European ban and re-entering the global supply, increasing competition and downward pressure on margins. This clearly indicates a gradual decline in the ADNOC refining segment over multiple quarters, exacerbated by shifts in global supply chains due to the Ukraine conflict. 3. Diversified Gas Portfolio Shift: OMV's gas supply and trading business moved from reliance on Russian gas arbitrage to a more diversified portfolio. They indicate that margins from this diversified approach may actually be better than those from earlier reliance on Russian gas. This suggests a strategic pivot rather than performance degradation, though it was prompted by disruptions following the Ukraine invasion. 4. Financial Resilience Despite Challenges: Despite the geopolitical and market pressures, OMV reports organic free cash flow of EUR 441 million in Q1 2025. Net debt remained stable, and leverage is low (12%). OMV holds a strong liquidity position (EUR 6.5B cash, EUR 4.2B undrawn facilities). This implies that while certain divisions like refining are struggling, the company as a whole has maintained financial strength, helped in part by its regional business focus and diversification strategy.",

        "Would you be willing to sign another contract with Gazprom for gas supply if circumstances changed and the\nopportunity arose? Or would you consider it too big a risk?\nAnswer by Alfred Stern:\nGazprom committed multiple, fundamental contract violations which caused OMV significant damage in 2022. We\ninitiated arbitration proceedings against Gazprom in the beginning of 2023 for which we received awards, including\ndamage awards, at the end of last year. We then offset these damage awards against open payments for gas\nsupplies in Austria. And as a consequence of this, Gazprom ceased the supply, which was both a contractual and a\nlegal violation, to which we then had to react to and terminated the gas supply contract.\nAs you know in the gas market, being able to count on reliable supplies through long-term gas contracts is a key\nprerequisite.

There's different dynamics playing there we see in general, that Jet is doing very well. We also see that the consumers on retail kind of are holding up, but we see some weakness in the business segments. And it's similar to what Reinhard described on polyolefins. So it's a different picture on the Energy segment.\n\nReinhard Florey\n\nAnd to your second question regarding dividends from we are currently seeing a shareholding of 75% of tales for OMV and 25% from ADNOC.
