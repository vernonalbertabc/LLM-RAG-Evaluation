 recontextualized_answer: **OMV Q4 2024 Conference Call – Q&A Transcript; February 4, 2025**

Following the release of OMV's quarterly financial results, the Q&A session provided insights into various critical aspects of the company’s performance. Among the topics discussed were margins, capital expenditures (CAPEX), and operational metrics such as utilization rates and inventory effects.

**Margins and CAPEX Discussion:**
A notable point of discussion was the company's refining margins, which are essential for assessing profitability in the context of fluctuating market conditions. The panel also highlighted the company's ongoing commitment to managing CAPEX effectively to support growth while ensuring that operational efficiencies are maintained.

**Operational Efficiencies:**
Utilization rates and inventory effects were addressed, underscoring the company's operational strategy to optimize production and inventory levels. In alignment with this, strategic projects like Borouge and Baystar were mentioned, as they play significant roles in enhancing market presence and leveraging demand in key sectors.

**Future Outlook:**
As the dialogue transitioned into segments concerning renewable fuels and energy management, the emphasis was placed on gas supply and storage, particularly in Eastern Europe. Notably, the company is navigating a complex macro environment while aiming for growth in low-carbon initiatives.

**Dividend Strategy:**
In response to a question by Sasikanth Chilukuru from Morgan Stanley regarding dividend payouts relative to cash flow from operations (CFFO), it was pointed out that this year's payout is set at 28%, a slight decrease from last year's 29%. This prompted further inquiries into the factors influencing this decision. Chilukuru noted that at a 30% CFFO payout, OMV could have potentially maintained flat dividends year-on-year. He also referenced a year-on-year growth rate of the regular dividend, which has decreased to 3.5% this year compared to 5% last year. This raised pertinent questions about the implications of the slowed growth rate under current circumstances and whether this is a sustainable trend moving forward. 

In summary, the discussion covered crucial aspects of OMV’s financial strategies and operational performance, providing investors with a comprehensive overview of the company’s positioning in a challenging market landscape while addressing specific stakeholder concerns about dividends and growth trajectories.

 recontextualized_answer: In response to a question posed by Sasikanth Chilukuru from Morgan Stanley regarding our dividend payout relative to cash flow from operations (CFFO), I note that while this year's payout stands at 28% and last year’s was 29%, these small differences indicate a consistent approach. Interestingly, at a 30% CFFO payout, we could have opted to keep the dividend flat year-on-year. This raises the question of what specific factors we take into account when making these decisions.

Moreover, I want to highlight that the year-on-year growth rate of the regular dividend has also slowed to 3.5% this year, down from 5% last year. This deceleration prompts us to consider its implications for our long-term strategy. Can we view this growth rate as sustainable given the current macroeconomic environment?

Reinhard Florey, in his subsequent response, emphasizes that maintaining a payout percentage within the range of 20% to 30% reflects considerable strength and confidence in our financial position, illustrating that the slight variation in our payout ratio compared to last year is negligible and signals our commitment to shareholder returns despite the prevailing economic conditions.

The difference in the payout ratio compared to last year is minimal, indicating consistency.

As such, we are maintaining the payout ratio at the upper end of the range, reflecting our strong confidence in our financial stability. This decision signals our dedication to delivering value even amid uncertainty. 

Continuing with our progressive dividend policy, we have successfully increased the regular dividend by EUR 0.10, which is in line with our commitment to enhancing shareholder returns. While this increase may appear modest compared to last year's figures, when expressed in percentages, it is only slightly lower than before. This slight decrease can be attributed to the need for us to maintain a balance between the additional variable dividend—introduced three years ago as a special dividend—and the regular dividend. Our aim is to ensure that both elements of our dividend strategy remain reliable and sustainable for our shareholders.

 recontextualized_answer: In light of our commitment to rewarding our shareholders despite the numerous challenges presented by the current economic environment, we have maintained our payout ratio at the upper end of our projected range. As we've previously discussed, we honored our pledge to increase the regular dividend by EUR 0.10, reflecting a consistent strategy that is in line with our progressive dividend policy. 

Now, if we analyze this increase in percentage terms, it may appear slightly lower than the previous year. However, this adjustment is deliberate and grounded in the necessity of balancing the additional variable dividend with the regular dividend. Our introduction of the variable element, which we initially referred to as a special dividend three years ago, has proven to be a reliable component of our shareholder return strategy. 

Furthermore, it is crucial to maintain a careful approach as we strive to stay below the 30% leverage threshold, a target we currently exceed comfortably. This approach ensures we are judicious in our financial decisions, emphasizing the importance of not inflating the progressive regular dividend at the expense of our overall fiscal health. Ultimately, we remain steadfast in fulfilling our obligations to our shareholders, rewarding them in a generous and sustainable manner.

 recontextualized_answer: Certainly! Here's a recontextualized version of the original chunk, incorporating relevant information from the surrounding context while maintaining its core message:

---

To ensure sustainable growth and shareholder satisfaction, we prioritize maintaining a balance between the additional variable dividend and regular dividend, especially as we navigate our financial strategies. Currently, we are significantly below the 30% leverage threshold, which is crucial for our financial health and flexibility; this situation allows us to be cautious yet generous. Therefore, it's essential not to overly compress the dividend increase in favor of the progressive regular dividend. We are committed to fulfilling our promises regarding dividends, as evidenced by our ongoing rewards to shareholders, which we consider those important. This approach not only reflects our dedication to stakeholders but also positions us favorably for potential opportunities, such as the acquisition of Nova Chemicals, which may bring added value to our portfolio.

 recontextualized_answer: As we continue to negotiate with ADNOC regarding the potential combination of Borouge and Borealis on an equal shares, equal partnership basis, we envision this joint venture as a robust platform for growth. Should the acquisition of Nova Chemicals go through, the intention is for OMV to inject more capital into this joint venture to fund its expansion. This strategic move would not only enhance our position in the polyolefins market but also create a leading global company, allowing us to leverage additional synergies from the strong feedstock portfolio associated with Nova.

 recontextualized_answer: **Recontextualized Version:**

Answer by Alfred Stern:

As we look toward 2025, we anticipate maintaining at least last year's polyolefin margin levels, which were notably robust, specifically for both polyethylene and polypropylene, projected to remain above EUR 400/t. Our sales volumes at Borealis, including contributions from our joint ventures, are expected to increase by an additional 200 kt, bringing the total to 4.1 million tonnes. This growth is particularly impressive considering we achieved a 10% volume increase last year, indicating a significant recovery in market conditions alongside the recovery of margins.

This positive trend is further underscored by our enhanced performance across various segments. The strong growth we've experienced in specialty sales has been a key driver of our improved results, reflecting a broad-based increase in productivity sales. This diversified growth is a promising sign for Borealis, reinforcing our confidence in surpassing the EUR 400/t threshold in 2025.
actual_chunk: Answer by Alfred Stern:
For 2025 we should at least be at the polyolefin margin level of last year, i.e. for both polyethylene and
polypropylene above EUR 400/t. Our sales volumes at Borealis, including the sales from joint ventures, will go up by
another 200 kt to 4.1 mn t. As I highlighted in my speech, it's actually quite amazing that we were able to grow

polypropylene above EUR 400/t. Our sales volumes at Borealis, including the sales from joint ventures, will go up by
another 200 kt to 4.1 mn t. As I highlighted in my speech, it's actually quite amazing that we were able to grow

Answer by Alfred Stern:

As we look toward 2025, we anticipate maintaining at least last year's polyolefin margin levels, which were notably robust, specifically for both polyethylene and polypropylene, projected to remain above EUR 400/t. Our sales volumes at Borealis, including contributions from our joint ventures, are expected to increase by an additional 200 kt, bringing the total to 4.1 million tonnes. This growth is particularly impressive considering we achieved a 10% volume increase last year, indicating a significant recovery in market conditions alongside the recovery of margins.

This positive trend is further underscored by our enhanced performance across various segments. The strong growth we've experienced in specialty sales has been a key driver of our improved results, reflecting a broad-based increase in productivity sales. This diversified growth is a promising sign for Borealis, reinforcing our confidence in surpassing the EUR 400/t threshold in 2025.",1,1,1560,500,100,True,True,What is OMV's current debt level and financial leverage position in 2025?,False,,
20,"title = omv_transcript_2024Q4

 recontextualized_answer: The improved results at Borealis can largely be attributed to our strategic focus on specialty sales, which constitutes a significant percentage of our overall throughput. This growth spans both specialty and productivity sales across various segments, reflecting a robust recovery in the marketplace and a positive sign for our operations moving forward. As we project for 2025, we anticipate maintaining a solid margin, with results expected to exceed EUR 400/t. 

However, we must remain cognizant of the evolving regulatory landscape, particularly concerning circular chemicals in Europe. There's a known slowdown in this area, partly due to weaker regulations and a less predictable environment, which may impact our Organic CAPEX plans over the next five years. In light of this, we have allocated around 15% of our capital expenditures to sustainable chemicals, and we are closely monitoring how changes in regulatory frameworks could affect the viability of specific projects.
actual_chunk: That's a key contribution to the improved results. With the high percentage of specialty sales that Borealis has, this
growth was across specialty and productivity sales. So across all the different segments, which I see as a positive
sign. At a minimum, we will be above EUR 400/t in 2025.

 recontextualized_answer: In response to Matthew Lofting's inquiry regarding the stocking cycle and its apparent weakening in 2024, Alfred Stern elaborated on the dynamics observed in Q1 of 2024 and the assumptions for Chemicals margins in 2025. He noted that before 2024, the industry had experienced an unprecedented and prolonged de-stocking cycle influenced by various factors, including the aftermath of COVID-19, disrupted supply chains, and an increase in demand during the pandemic. This de-stocking phase concluded in 2024, allowing Borealis to achieve a volume increase of approximately 10% year-over-year, particularly impressive in Q4 of 2024.

Looking ahead, Alfred emphasized that this upward trend is a positive indication for the company's performance across all segments. Alongside the volume growth, margins have also shown signs of improvement, reinforcing a favorable outlook. He mentioned that while year-end figures are traditionally affected by working capital and storage management, for 2025, Borealis anticipates margins to remain above EUR 400 per ton for polyethylene and polypropylene. Furthermore, the company expects to capitalize on opportunities for even higher sales volumes, partly due to the ongoing ramp-up of production capabilities.

In response to the inquiry about the expected cash inflow from the Borouge 4 project and the timeline for its completion, Reinhard Florey clarified the relationship between Borouge and Borealis. He emphasized that the concept of Borouge 4 being recontributed to Borouge is independent of any broader transactions that may occur between Borealis and Borouge. Florey acknowledged that while the project remains ongoing, it is currently not possible to specify an exact value for the project. As it stands, Borealis holds a 40% stake in Borouge 4, with ADNOC owning the remaining 60%. This distribution will remain in place until a future re-contribution occurs, at which point cash payments from Borouge 4 will be addressed. 

In the context of the Baystar asset, which is a separate entity under discussion, Florey was also questioned about the path to profitability and whether recovery in industry margins or further operational improvements are required. This indicates that while Borouge 4 has its unique dynamics, there are parallel considerations for profitability across different assets, highlighting the interconnected nature of project funding and financial performance within the organization.

39,"title = omv_transcript_2024Q4

 recontextualized_answer: The ADNOC refining performance was clearly deteriorating this year, primarily due to several factors affecting the refining margins. A significant issue stems from the crowded export markets within the refining business. On one hand, we are facing increased pressure from Chinese refineries, which are aggressively competing for market share. Concurrently, the domestic market—particularly in relation to vehicles—has been rapidly shifting towards electric vehicles, leading to a decrease in local fuel demand and consequently, more fuels being exported.

On the other hand, refineries globally, especially those outside of Russia, are processing Russian crude despite the European ban, which has not been as effective as intended. This situation has introduced additional competition from Russian products that are making their way into markets through refineries in India, Turkey, Pakistan, and elsewhere, further straining the global refining landscape. These developments have significantly impacted refining margins, particularly in Europe, where the margins have seen a notable decline—projected to be USD 6/bbl in 2025 and even lower as we enter Q1 2025, compared to USD 11.7/bbl in 2023. The overall outlook indicates a challenging environment for refiners as they navigate these pressures in a swiftly changing market.

countries outside of Russia, are processing Russian crude in refineries. And the ban that we see in Europe did not","The ADNOC refining performance was clearly deteriorating this year, primarily due to several factors affecting the refining margins. A significant issue stems from the crowded export markets within the refining business. On one hand, we are facing increased pressure from Chinese refineries, which are aggressively competing for market share. Concurrently, the domestic market—particularly in relation to vehicles—has been rapidly shifting towards electric vehicles, leading to a decrease in local fuel demand and consequently, more fuels being exported.

On the other hand, refineries globally, especially those outside of Russia, are processing Russian crude despite the European ban, which has not been as effective as intended. This situation has introduced additional competition from Russian products that are making their way into markets through refineries in India, Turkey, Pakistan, and elsewhere, further straining the global refining landscape. These developments have significantly impacted refining margins, particularly in Europe, where the margins have seen a notable decline—projected to be USD 6/bbl in 2025 and even lower as we enter Q1 2025, compared to USD 11.7/bbl in 2023. The overall outlook indicates a challenging environment for refiners as they navigate these pressures in a swiftly changing market.",1,1,1850,500,100,True,True,What is OMV's current debt level and financial leverage position in 2025?,False,,

 recontextualized_answer: The current landscape of the refining business is marked by significant competitive pressures. On one hand, we are witnessing an increase in competition from Chinese refineries. The domestic market, particularly for vehicles, has rapidly shifted towards electric vehicles, resulting in a higher volume of fuels being exported. Meanwhile, countries outside of Russia continue to process Russian crude in their refineries, effectively circumventing the European ban that was expected to limit this activity. 

As a consequence, we are seeing a growing competition from Russian products being refined in markets like India, Turkey, and Pakistan. This influx has profoundly impacted global refining dynamics. In Europe specifically, this competitive landscape has led to a decline in refining margins; for instance, margins for 2024 were significantly lower than those in 2023, dropping from USD 11.7/bbl to USD 7.1/bbl. Current projections suggest that refining margins will further decrease to USD 6/bbl by 2025, with the first quarter of 2025 already indicating figures below this expectation. 

In the midst of these challenges, the market is also shifting focus towards renewable fuels, indicating a potential area of growth amidst a volatile environment.

 recontextualized_answer: As we analyze the outlook for refining margins, which are projected to be around USD 6/bbl in 2025—lower than the already diminished rates of USD 7.1/bbl in 2024 and USD 11.7/bbl in 2023—it's important to note that we are currently experiencing even lower margins as we enter Q1 of 2025. In this challenging environment, the biofuel sector, particularly renewable fuels, has faced considerable headwinds. 

During this period, Michele Della Vigna from Goldman Sachs raised a pertinent question regarding the trends in biofuel margins over the past year, which he described as ""very volatile"" and ""largely disappointing."" He inquired about the future evolution of these margins and whether there remains enthusiasm for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) opportunities in the coming years. 

In response, Alfred Stern acknowledged the difficulties encountered last year, attributing the disappointing margin developments to recent regulatory changes in various countries and the introduction of new production capacities. He mentioned that last year his team took a final investment decision (FID) on their SAF plant in Petrobrazi, with plans to initiate production in 2028. He remained optimistic, suggesting that both regulatory and voluntary demand would surge in the interim, creating a short market position that his team aims to capitalize on.

During the Q4 2024 conference call, Henry Tarr from Berenberg raised a crucial inquiry about our potential dealings with Gazprom in the future—specifically, whether we would consider signing another gas supply contract if the circumstances changed or if the risks are deemed manageable.

In response, Alfred Stern emphasized that Gazprom's past actions, including multiple fundamental contract violations, had inflicted significant damage on OMV in 2022. This breach of contract significantly impacted our operations and prompted us to pursue arbitration proceedings against Gazprom at the beginning of 2023. We ultimately received favorable awards, including damages, by the end of the previous year, which we offset against outstanding payments owed for gas supplies in Austria. However, Gazprom's decision to halt supply constituted both a contractual and legal violation, forcing us to terminate our existing gas supply contract as a necessary response.

However, he pointed out that the current winter-summer spreads do not favor gas injection, raising critical questions about the company's plans for this year. Specifically, he asked about the enforcement mechanisms in place to ensure that the goal of reaching 90% storage capacity is achieved, particularly if these spreads continue to remain negative. 

Alfred Stern responded by clarifying that OMV currently holds approximately 65%-67% of gas storage capacity, a noticeable decrease from over 80% at the same time last year. This change is attributed to multiple factors, including a colder winter this year compared to the previous one, as well as fluctuations in flows through the Ukrainian pipeline, which have further complicated the situation.

 recontextualized_answer: **Recontextualized Version:**

We are currently operating at about a 65%-67% gas storage level, which is notably lower than the above 80% level we had at this time last year. This decline can be attributed to several factors: firstly, the current winter is colder than the previous year, which saw an unusually warm period that resulted in decreased gas demand. Additionally, disruptions such as the cessation of flows through the Ukrainian pipeline have further contributed to our storage depletion. 

As we navigate these challenges, it’s important to note that there are storage mandates we need to comply with, specifically minimum filling requirements. We are actively strategizing to transform this situation into a viable business opportunity. However, the present summer-winter spreads are negative, rendering injection into storage unprofitable. Therefore, it's imperative that we carefully select the right timing for refilling our storages, ensuring we can meet regulatory obligations while also securing a profitable outcome for the business.

 recontextualized_answer: To ensure that we have a profitable business in the current gas market, which is characterized by transparency in gas storage levels, it is crucial for us to manage our resources wisely. Storage mandates, or minimum filling requirements, necessitate that we monitor our gas storage closely, and we must also report these levels to the regulator.

 recontextualized_answer: In the context of OMV's Q4 2024 Conference Call, where Reinhard Florey addressed concerns regarding net working capital, he elaborated on the gas storage business's dynamics. Florey noted that while there may be temporary increases in working capital due to rising price levels, these fluctuations are manageable and contribute to a profitable operation. He highlighted the significant variability in storage levels, oscillating between high and low, which necessitates strategic planning.

Florey expressed his primary concern regarding market conditions, specifically the potential lack of advantageous summer-winter spreads which could hinder the ability to leverage profitable storage opportunities. He emphasized that without sufficient margins, or spreads, the decision to store gas becomes untenable, as they would be unable to forward sell any cubic meters effectively. Currently, the company is adopting a cautious, wait-and-see approach to gauge market developments.

Despite these concerns, Florey reassured stakeholders that he does not anticipate working capital to become an additional burden. He explained that the nature of working capital is cyclical—it ebbs and flows throughout the year, and thus, any capital input will eventually be reversed, meaning it doesn't represent a net loss. He concluded by stressing the importance of forward selling capabilities and the associated profit generation as key metrics for the business, rather than relying solely on specific financial cut-off dates at quarter or year-end, which could skew the operational outlook.

 recontextualized_answer: As we navigate the current market dynamics characterized by a strong swing between high and low storage levels, my concerns primarily center on the implications of summer-winter spreads, or lack thereof, on our business viability. Specifically, in a scenario where these spreads do not present a promising opportunity for profitable operations, we find ourselves in a position where we cannot afford to store natural gas unless we have forward sold those cubic meters. The real challenge arises when the margins—essentially the spreads—are insufficient to motivate forward sales. In light of this uncertainty, we adopt a wait-and-see approach to gauge the market development.

In this context, I do not see working capital as an additional burden that exacerbates our situation. Its fluctuations are manageable; any infusion of working capital will ultimately be balanced out in the opposite direction over the year. This fluidity indicates that working capital should not be evaluated based solely on static cut-off dates at the conclusion of a quarter or fiscal year. Instead, the more pressing consideration for our operations is the extent to which we can successfully forward sell, alongside the profits generated from those transactions. Our focus remains on strategic decision-making regarding forward sales, which directly impacts our profitability in the volatile market we're currently assessing. 

This leads into further discussions, such as those raised by Paul Redman from Exane BNP Paribas, regarding our new gas portfolio and the financial implications of not relying on Gazprom volumes.

margins and arbitrage that we could do on Russian gas supplies, this is maybe even quite lower than what we see
with the diversified gas portfolio that we have at the moment.","Paul Redman from Exane BNP Paribas raised an important question regarding the new gas portfolio, particularly in light of not having to rely on Gazprom volumes and the associated costs. He asked how this impacts the pricing dynamics, especially with the market currently valuing gas at around EUR 50/MWh. In response, Reinhard Florey explained that when considering the potential exposure to higher costs in the diversified gas portfolio, it's crucial to understand that the gas supply and trading business operates not merely on a cost basis but rather focuses on margins and arbitrage opportunities. 

He noted that when comparing the specific margins and arbitrage possibilities associated with Russian gas supplies against those of the diversified gas portfolio, the margins derived from the diversified portfolio could actually be more favorable. Florey emphasized that the business model does not hinge on individual market prices or indices; rather, it capitalizes on the ability to leverage trading arbitrage and maintain healthy supply margins with customers. As long as gas volumes are available and transport capacities are booked, the business remains positively positioned despite fluctuations in market prices.",1,1,1731,500,100,True,True,What is OMV's current debt level and financial leverage position in 2025?,False,,

 recontextualized_answer: Reinhard Florey has clarified that the potential exposure to higher costs in our diversified gas portfolio is not directly influenced by fluctuating individual market prices or indices. Instead, the profitability of our gas supply and trading business hinges on our ability to leverage trading arbitrage and maintain favorable supply margins with our customers. Currently, our diversified gas portfolio allows us to capitalize on these aspects, ensuring that our operations remain robust, provided that we have access to adequate gas volumes. We have already secured transport capacities and booked our terminal in Rotterdam for LNG volumes, which are operating at full capacity. This strategic positioning underpins our confidence in generating positive results moving forward, despite potential legislative shifts in markets like Romania that may pose challenges through 2025.

 recontextualized_answer: Reinhard Florey addressed concerns about potential loss-making in Romania, asserting that the company is diligently implementing measures to prevent this outcome through 2025. In the past, the operation has demonstrated solid profitability, although recent regulatory actions from the Romanian state—such as the capping of gas prices and electricity prices for households—have temporarily impacted that profitability. However, Florey emphasized that they are countering these challenges by leveraging export activities. Specifically, the company is currently positioned to export certain volumes of gas and electricity, which helps maintain profitability.

Furthermore, the planned expansion into renewable energy production, extending beyond traditional gas sources, is set to bolster profitability. As renewable energy contributions are increasingly valued in the market, this shift is expected to provide a solid foundation for future earnings. Florey expressed confidence that these strategic movements, alongside upcoming legislative exemptions for renewable projects, will ensure that the Romanian business will not fall into a loss-making situation.

 recontextualized_answer: The district heating network in Vienna currently serves around 400,000 households, and we aim to significantly scale our operations to supply approximately 200,000 of those households with geothermal energy. To achieve this ambitious goal, we will need to replicate our current pilot production efforts about seven times, which will involve a series of development initiatives and necessary investments. We are committed to executing this plan methodically to ensure its success. 

A key advantage we have in this endeavor is our strong partnership with Wien Energie, which operates the district heating network and facilitates access to all the connected households. This collaboration not only enhances our capacity to expand but also positions us favorably for the future. By 2030, we expect that approximately 20% of our total cash flows will stem from these sustainable projects, underscoring our commitment to a greener energy landscape.

**Reinhard Florey**

Thank you, Florian. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I appreciate your presence today. As we delve into the first quarter of 2025, it is important to note that the macro environment presented a mixed picture. There were growing concerns about the global economic outlook, particularly driven by uncertainties surrounding U.S. trade policy, which significantly impacted market confidence. This unease contributed to a broader sell-off in commodities, including oil, which dipped below $70 per barrel in mid-February. However, we did observe a moderate recovery in oil prices by the end of the quarter. 

In contrast, European gas prices rallied during the same period, buoyed by substantial draws on inventories due to elevated demand. Yet, as the quarter progressed and the demand began to tail off seasonally, gas prices eased in the latter half, especially with increased LNG inflows. Meanwhile, the refining indicator margin experienced considerable volatility. Although it showed some recovery compared to the previous quarter, it remained significantly below the robust levels seen in the same quarter last year.

 recontextualized_answer: European gas prices experienced a significant rally in mid-February, driven by substantial draws on inventories due to heightened demand. However, as the quarter progressed, prices eased in the latter half, influenced by increased LNG inflows and seasonal tailing off of demand. This dynamic reflects the broader macroeconomic context, where despite the recovery in certain sectors, challenges persisted. Notably, the refining indicator margin exhibited considerable volatility, demonstrating some average recovery compared to the previous quarter; nevertheless, it remained markedly below levels observed in the robust prior year quarter. This mixed performance in the gas and refining markets played out against a backdrop of fluctuating economic conditions, highlighted by stagnant growth in the construction sector and only a modest rebound in the automotive industry. As a result, while the increase in olefin prices indicated some improvement in demand, the overarching economic uncertainties continued to loom large.

 recontextualized_answer: European gas prices rallied to the mid-February on large draws on inventories due to elevated demand, but prices eased in the second half of the quarter as LNG inflows increased and as demand tailed off seasonally. The refining indicator margin was very volatile, on average, showing some recovery compared to the previous quarter, but it remains significantly below the strong prior year quarter. In this challenging environment, olefin indicator margins improved quarter-on-quarter, supported by stronger demand and tighter-than-expected supply, which was affected by outages at crackers and refineries.

However, broader macroeconomic challenges persisted, with the construction sector remaining stagnant and the automotive industry experiencing only a modest recovery. Consequently, the increase in olefin prices could not be fully passed on to customers, leading polyolefin indicator margins to average slightly below the levels of the previous quarter while still remaining slightly above the prior year's figures.

 recontextualized_answer: The automotive industry experienced only a modest recovery, and as a result, the increase in olefin prices could not be fully passed on to customers. This limitation led to polyolefin indicator margins averaging slightly below the levels of the previous quarter, although they remained slightly above those of the same period last year. Despite these challenges in pricing, our overall performance in related sectors remained robust; for instance, our polyolefin sales volumes, including those from joint ventures, grew by 10% year-on-year. This growth occurred alongside stable fuel sales volumes, even as hydrocarbon production saw a 12% year-on-year decline, influenced by the divestment of our Malaysian assets.

 recontextualized_answer: The clean operating results of the Energy segment saw a decline of EUR 142 million, bringing the total to EUR 910 million. This decrease can be attributed to an inability of the improved exploration and production (E&P) results to offset the decline in gas marketing and power contributions. Notably, while the performance of E&P improved—driven by favorable market conditions resulting in around EUR 14 million gains—gas prices surged significantly compared to the first quarter of 2024, contrasting with a drop in oil prices. This setback in gas marketing and power was part of a broader trend, as production volumes across the board declined by 42,000 barrels per day, largely due to the divestment of Malaysian assets and natural declines in production from Norway and New Zealand. Despite increased output in other areas, this overall decline exerted further pressure on the clean operating results, which were also impacted by rising production costs, now at $10.1 per barrel, as well as reduced sales volumes that mirrored production losses.

 recontextualized_answer: The clean operating results of the Energy segment experienced a decline of EUR 142 million, totaling EUR 910 million, largely influenced by a combination of factors including production challenges and market dynamics. While the exploration and production (E&P) sector showed improved performance with a positive market effect of around EUR 14 million, it was overshadowed by a decline in gas marketing and power contributions. Specifically, production volumes fell by 42,000 barrels per day, primarily due to the divestment of Malaysian assets and the natural decline of production in Norway and New Zealand. This decline in production was only partially mitigated by increased output in the media sector. Accompanying this drop in production volumes, production costs slightly increased to $10.1 per barrel. Sales volumes mirrored the downturn in production and were further affected by the lifting schedule in Norway. The significant decline in gas marketing and power results worsened the situation, showing a sharp decrease of EUR 102 million, highlighting reductions observed in both eastern and western markets.

As highlighted in the recent trading update following the Borouge Group International deal, the reclassification of Borealis as an asset held for sale is expected to have a positive impact on our clean operating results, contributing around EUR 140 million per quarter. This reclassification, along with the exclusion of the associated results, reinforces our financial position without affecting cash flow.

Looking forward, we anticipate substantial dividend payments from Borouge, enhancing our overall financial stability.

In the current volatile environment, where uncertainty reigns, I wanted to gain insight into how you're managing the present situation, especially with the prospect of a potentially lower price environment on the horizon. Are there specific mitigating measures you are considering taking, particularly concerning Capital Expenditures (CapEx)? Or do you feel that your financial framework is robust enough at this point that adjustments to CapEx are not necessary just yet? Any additional comments you can provide around this would be greatly appreciated. 

Following this inquiry, I also have a question regarding upstream strategies, possibly for Beri. In previous discussions, you mentioned the prospect of enhancing your production capabilities through acquisitions. Given the current market landscape, how are you viewing the opportunity set in this regard? Is there a belief that any downturn in crude prices could present acquisition opportunities, or would you prefer to finalize the BGI transaction before pursuing any new avenues in that direction?

Yes. Thanks, Ram, for the question. Indeed, when we are looking at the challenges of the market, we are observing varying movements in demand. Specifically, there has been a slight decrease in the demand for refinery products. However, this shift is accompanied by potential opportunities, particularly in the chemicals sector, which could lead to increased volumes. We have seen developments reflecting this trend already in the first quarter. While refinery margins have been somewhat volatile, they have remained stable enough to allow us to maintain our utilization rates. Currently, we are averaging over a refining margin of $6, which positions us well for future opportunities.

Yes. Thanks, Ram, for the question. Indeed, when we are looking at the challenges of the market, we are observing varying movements in demand. Specifically, there has been a slight decrease in the demand for refinery products. However, this shift is accompanied by potential opportunities, particularly in the chemicals sector, which could lead to increased volumes.

 recontextualized_answer: While we have maintained a stable average refining margin of around $6, we must acknowledge that the mix of our refinery outputs is changing. In the first quarter, we experienced a tilt towards production on the lower end of the refining spectrum, which has resulted in lower margins. Furthermore, middle distillates remain under pressure, aside from sustainable aviation fuels and overall kerosene. However, there is promising potential on the chemical side, particularly with our petrochemical products, which can progress further.

 recontextualized_answer: In the context of shifting market dynamics, there are emerging opportunities, particularly in petrochemicals. We are observing a notable improvement in olefin prices, which in April have risen significantly—approximately by $100. Specifically, in the polyethylene sector, there has been a $50 enhancement. This positive trend suggests that while we face certain risks, such as fluctuating margins at the lower end of the refinery mix impacting our overall profitability, there are also viable market opportunities that we need to strategically navigate. Balancing these factors is crucial as we assess the evolving landscape, especially given the potential impacts of feedstock costs and regional price variations that have recently come into play. In contrast to the advantages seen in our Nordic crackers, which may experience slightly lower light feedstock benefits than last year, the North American market is poised to gain from falling oil prices. As gas prices have decreased at the start of the second quarter, the implications of these changes will require careful consideration moving forward.

 recontextualized_answer: Building on the previous observations about market dynamics and the price movements of olefins and polyethylene, we turn our attention to feedstock costs. Currently, we note that the light feedstock advantage experienced in our Nordic crackers is anticipated to be slightly lower compared to last year. This shift is primarily due to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) region benefiting from low oil prices, while gas prices have remained elevated, particularly in the first quarter.

Alejandro Vigil has raised important questions regarding the performance of ADNOC's refining and trading, specifically asking for clarification on the weak performance mentioned in the call and whether it stems from reduced trading opportunities or challenges on the refining side. Following this inquiry, there's a consideration about the implications of their strategic moves. 

Addressing the second question, it's worth noting that while the company maintains a robust balance sheet, the recent transaction involving Borouge does introduce an increase in leverage. This prompts consideration about whether the company plans to pursue divestments in the coming years to counterbalance this rise in leverage. However, as Reinhard Florey will elaborate, there is no immediate intention to divest, as the company stands firm in its streamlined portfolio and continues to exhibit confidence in its financial position.

 recontextualized_answer: The first quarter has certainly presented challenges, and the team is very focused on navigating this difficult and volatile environment to seize the best trading opportunities available. However, as we look ahead to Q2, the refining margin in the Middle East also appears to be quite challenging. This tough situation is driven not only by the ongoing economic uncertainty but also by significant changes in the availability of both lighter and heavier crudes.

 recontextualized_answer: In light of a tough first quarter, it's clear that the team is working diligently to navigate a challenging and volatile environment by seizing the best trading opportunities. However, the refining margins in the Middle East are particularly strained, especially as we move into Q2. This difficult climate is driven not only by persistent economic uncertainty but also by significant shifts in the availability and pricing of both lighter and heavier crude oils. Currently, heavier crudes have become relatively more expensive than their lighter counterparts, further complicating the landscape for refiners and exacerbating the challenging refining environment instead of alleviating it. 

As we move forward, this context sets the stage for a deeper discussion on related topics, including the operational strategies and financial implications for entities like the Borouge Group International, particularly concerning their floor dividend and how it may be affected by ongoing macroeconomic changes.

I guess the main focus for discussion is really around the Borouge Group International (BGI) and its established floor dividend. Given the current fluctuations in the macro environment and the associated leverage targets for the combined group, how robust do you think this dividend structure is? Alternatively, what specific circumstances would need to arise for the floor dividend to be considered at risk at this time? 

Reinhard Florey

Yes, Henry, thanks for the question. I appreciate that the floor dividend is indeed a significant incentive for PGI and PI investors within OMV. The strength of this floor dividend is designed to adapt according to our business plans, even in riskier scenarios. From our perspective today, we do not anticipate that the floor dividend will come under threat. What’s truly beneficial about BGI is that it's a global enterprise, ensuring a solid presence in key markets including the U.S., Asia, the Middle East, and Europe.

Indeed, in a general note, the exposure to tariffs as we see it in the narrow sense will be marginal to OMV.

 recontextualized_answer: Given the intricate interdependencies in trade between the U.S. and Canada, it is unlikely that either country would impose tariffs against the other. The mutual reliance of various industries on Canadian production suggests that any economic repercussions would be minimal. However, even if we hypothetically considered the imposition of such tariffs, calculations indicate that the potential negative impact on our business would only amount to a small double-digit million figure. When viewed in the context of the overall scope and scale of the business at hand, this potential impact appears marginal from our current perspective.

Sasikanth Chilukuru","Given the intricate interdependencies in trade between the U.S. and Canada, it is unlikely that either country would impose tariffs against the other. The mutual reliance of various industries on Canadian production suggests that any economic repercussions would be minimal. However, even if we hypothetically considered the imposition of such tariffs, calculations indicate that the potential negative impact on our business would only amount to a small double-digit million figure.

 recontextualized_answer: Thank you for the question. Regarding the refining market, April's performance is unfortunately only slightly better than the average we observed in the first quarter, which stood at approximately $6.7. For the current period, we are seeing an average of $6.4, indicating that we are still facing a challenging environment in the Middle East.

Thank you for the question. On the refining market, unfortunately, April is slightly better than the average of the first quarter. The average for the first quarter was approximately $6.7, while it now stands at $6.4. Thus, it remains a tough environment in the Middle East, with a lower start in Q2 compared to the average of Q1.

Now, it's important to consider that, especially in Europe, there are also inland margins that have been volatile since Q4 of last year. Different dynamics are at play in this sector; for instance, we are seeing that Jet fuel is performing very well, indicating some resilience. While retail consumers seem to be holding steady, there is noticeable weakness in the business segments. This situation reflects the challenges outlined by Reinhard regarding polyolefins, suggesting a more complex landscape within the Energy segment overall.

And to your second question regarding dividends, we are currently observing a shareholding of 75% for OMV and 25% for ADNOC. The minority shareholder, as you termed it, is indeed ADNOC. It's important to note that there is a certain negative cash impact from the fully consolidated goals on our balance sheet when there is an outflow related to this 25% when we eventually receive the dividend.

 recontextualized_answer: Reinhard Florey

In response to your second question regarding dividends, it's important to note that our current shareholding structure includes 75% from OMV and 25% from ADNOC, meaning ADNOC serves as the minority shareholder. This situation results in a particular negative cash impact on our balance sheet due to the fully consolidated goals when there is an outflow related to the 25% stake during dividend payouts. It's crucial to understand this within the broader framework, as we are also experiencing contrasting dynamics, particularly when we look at our positions in Borouge. While the dividends received from Borealis and the trading activities involving ADNOC result in a positive scenario for OMV, this necessitates adjustments to expected financial metrics. For instance, the anticipated equalization payment and capital injection into BGI, originally forecasted at EUR 1.6 billion, may be revised down to around EUR 1.5 billion after accounting for the dividends flowing from both Borealis and Borouge, illustrating how interconnected these aspects of our operations are.

 recontextualized_answer: Reinhard Florey addressed the financial structure regarding shareholding, noting that OMV currently holds a 75% stake in the venture, with ADNOC holding the remaining 25%. This configuration designates ADNOC as the minority shareholder. Florey highlighted that while there are implications for cash flow, particularly concerning the cash outflow from the minority's dividend when received, the situation varies in the case of Borouge. 

On the other hand, dividends from Borouge and the overall financial interaction with Borealis depict a more favorable outlook for OMV. The dividends flowing in from Borealis, which are being traded out to ADNOC, contribute positively to OMV's financial position. Consequently, Florey elaborated on the anticipated equalization payment and capital injection into BGI, expected to be around EUR 1.6 billion. He indicated that this figure will likely be adjusted to approximately EUR 1.5 billion following the dividend payouts, reflecting the inflows from both Borealis and Borouge. 

The discussion then shifted to broader economic conditions, where Florian Greger raised concerns regarding macroeconomic uncertainty but noted that oil prices remain robust above $60.

 recontextualized_answer: As we continue to prioritize our operating cost optimization and efficiencies, it’s important to highlight the flexibility we have regarding our capital expenditures (CapEx). As you may recall, during the COVID crisis in 2020, when the market faced unprecedented challenges and oil prices plummeted towards $40, we successfully managed to reduce our CapEx by more than 30% within that year. This demonstrates not only our ability to adapt in times of crisis but also the inherent resilience of our company. Coupled with this, we also maintain a strong net working capital position, which acts as a buffer when oil prices and margins decline. This flexibility allows us to swiftly release capital and convert net working capital into cash, ensuring we have reserves available to fortify our balance sheet. Overall, these proactive strategies across our operations underscore our commitment to maintaining financial stability and responsiveness in a volatile market.

Reinhard Florey

Yes. Thanks, Matt. To elaborate on the floor dividend, it’s important to understand the broader implications of our current financial positioning. The floor dividend for the entire PTI group is approximately USD 2.2 billion. In light of the current circumstances, and following the anticipated capital increase, OMV’s share will adjust from 46.9% to about 43%. This change translates to a net inflow of roughly USD 1 billion, which is approximately EUR 900 million for OMV. 

This adjustment is crucial as it fits into the overall financial framework we’re discussing, specifically how the consolidation will affect our operating cash flow. Essentially, we will observe that the operating cash flow aligns closely with the net cash flow, which will be reflected in the dividend distribution. This dynamic is a key aspect of the nonconsolidated or equity-consolidated methodology that we will employ within the BGI group in conjunction with this transaction.
