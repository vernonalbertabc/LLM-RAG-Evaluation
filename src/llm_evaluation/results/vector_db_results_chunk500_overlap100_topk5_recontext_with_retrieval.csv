Notably, refining margins and the transition to renewable fuels were highlighted, emphasizing OMV's commitment to adapting to market changes while navigating the energy landscape. 

As investor Sasikanth Chilukuru from Morgan Stanley posed questions regarding dividend strategy, he noted the current payout relative to cash flow from operations (CFFO), which stands at 28% this year compared to 29% last year. This slight difference, while seemingly minor, raises important questions about the factors influencing such decisions. Chilukuru further pointed out that at a 30% CFFO payout, the dividend could have remained flat year-on-year, prompting inquiry into OMV’s dividend growth trajectory. The discussion also touched upon the year-on-year growth rate of the regular dividend, which has slowed to 3.5% this year from 5% last year, leading to concerns about sustainability and the implications of the current macroeconomic environment on future dividends.

2," recontextualized_answer: In light of the ongoing discussions about our dividend policy and its alignment with cash flow from operations (CFFO), I’d like to delve into the specifics of our recent dividend payout decisions. This year's payout is at 28%, slightly down from last year's 29%. While these percentages might appear as small differences, they hold substantial implications. Notably, a 30% CFFO payout could have allowed us to maintain the dividend at a flat rate year-on-year. This leads to the question of what key factors we consider in determining these adjustments.

Moreover, it’s important to highlight that the year-on-year growth rate of the regular dividend has also slowed, recorded at 3.5% this year compared to 5% last year. This prompts further inquiry into what this deceleration in growth might indicate. Is this rate of growth sustainable in our current macroeconomic environment? As we approach dividend decisions, we weigh these nuances carefully, considering both our financial health and external market conditions.

Ultimately, these reflections on dividend strategy are integral to our overall financial approach, which aims to convey strength and confidence to our stakeholders. We operate within a target dividend payout range of 20% to 30%, which positions us on the upper end of this spectrum.

5," recontextualized_answer: In light of our commitment to our shareholders, it is essential to understand the nuances of our dividend strategy, particularly as we navigate a challenging economic environment while still striving to reward our investors. As part of our progressive dividend policy, we've successfully increased the regular dividend by EUR 0.10. While the percentage increase may appear slightly lower compared to last year, this adjustment is influenced by the need to maintain a balance between the additional variable dividend and the regular dividend.

Introducing the additional variable element, which we previously referred to as a special dividend, three years ago was a strategic move aimed at enhancing our offerings. It’s crucial to communicate that we are committed to making this variable dividend a reliable component of our financial strategy, keeping it in line with our overarching objective of delivering value to our shareholders. 

As we continue to operate well below the 30% leverage threshold—an important benchmark for us—this context underscores the careful consideration we must apply to our dividend decisions.

6," recontextualized_answer: As we continue to ensure our financial stability, it's crucial to communicate that our current leverage is significantly below the 30% threshold, which we are far from approaching at this time. This metric not only underscores our robust financial health but also emphasizes the importance of maintaining a balanced approach in our dividend strategy. While we have introduced an additional variable element to our dividends—initially branded as a special dividend three years ago—it's vital that we do not overly increase the progressive regular dividend at the expense of other financial commitments. We want to ensure that our shareholders recognize our commitment; we are indeed keeping our promises on the dividend front and rewarding them in a very generous manner. This commitment to our shareholders is a cornerstone of our strategy moving forward.

As we move forward with our discussions regarding a potential collaboration between Borouge and Borealis, it is important to consider the broader market dynamics impacting our polyolefin businesses. During the OMV Q4 2024 Conference Call on February 4, 2025, Ramchandra Kamath from Barclays raised a pertinent question about the price outlook for polyolefins in 2025. He noted that the recovery pace appears rather slow, especially with several new polyethylene projects poised to launch, particularly in China. This raises valid concerns about potential supply-side risks that could exert further pressure on prices or margins for polyolefins.

In response, Alfred Stern addressed these concerns by providing an optimistic outlook for the upcoming year, reaffirming that for 2025, we should anticipate maintaining at least the same polyolefin margin levels as the previous year. Specifically, he projected margins for both polyethylene and polypropylene to remain above EUR 400 per ton. Furthermore, he highlighted that Borealis's sales volumes, which include those from joint ventures, are expected to increase by an additional 200,000 tons, reaching a total of 4.1 million tons. Stern emphasized that the growth of 10% in volume last year indicates a significant recovery, which aligns with the expected recovery of market margins.

Answer by Alfred Stern: For 2025, we anticipate maintaining at least the polyolefin margin levels achieved last year, meaning both polyethylene and polypropylene are expected to remain above EUR 400 per tonne. Additionally, we expect our sales volumes at Borealis, which will include contributions from our joint ventures, to increase by another 200,000 tonnes to reach a total of 4.1 million tonnes. This growth is noteworthy; as I highlighted in my speech, achieving a 10% increase in volumes last year is indicative of a significant recovery in the market—not just in terms of sales volumes, but also in the recovery of margins.

For 2025, we anticipate maintaining a robust performance, with at least polyolefin margins comparable to last year, specifically for both polyethylene and polypropylene exceeding EUR 400/t. Our sales volumes at Borealis, which include those from joint ventures, are expected to rise by an additional 200 kt to reach 4.1 million t. This achievement is particularly noteworthy, considering our impressive 10% growth in volume last year, indicating a significant recovery not only in volume but also in market margins.

That's a key contribution to the improved results. With Borealis's high percentage of specialty sales, this growth spans across both specialty and productivity segments, which I view as a very positive indication for our overall performance. Consequently, we are poised to be at a minimum above EUR 400/t in 2025.

Nonetheless, there are concerns regarding the slowdown of circular chemicals, which we've linked to weaker regulatory frameworks and less certainty in the market environment, particularly in Europe.

20," recontextualized_answer: Alfred Stern explains that the slowdown in circular chemicals in Europe is directly linked to the delays in regulatory frameworks, notably the Packaging Waste Directive, which has not yet been fully integrated into national laws. This regulatory uncertainty raises questions about its impact on Borealis' Organic Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) plan over the next five years.

By the end of 2024, this cycle had largely concluded, allowing Borealis to achieve about 10% more sales volumes compared to the previous year, particularly in Q4/24. This improvement is indicative of our successful repositioning in the market and reflects a broader trend of recovery across all segments. I regard this as a positive signal, especially as we also observed improved margins during this time. 

Looking ahead to 2025, we are anticipating margins to exceed EUR 400 per ton for polyethylene and polypropylene, supported by our ability to sell even greater volumes due in part to forthcoming ramp-ups in production.

Our path to profitability for the Baystar asset is very clear and hinges on achieving operational stability first. We have made significant progress on the cracker facility, which is essential for our operations. As of now, we are also making notable advancements with the polyethylene plant. This facility will enter a maintenance window in the first quarter, during which we will implement additional optimizations to further enhance operational efficiency.

Additionally, the domestic vehicle market has seen a rapid shift towards electric vehicles, resulting in an uptick in fuel exports. Furthermore, countries outside of Russia have adapted to process Russian crude in their refineries, undermining the impact of Europe's ban on such imports. This scenario has led to intensified competition from Russian refined products being processed in locations like India, Turkey, and Pakistan, further affecting global market dynamics.

On one hand, Chinese refineries are exerting significant pressure, while the domestic vehicle market has seen a rapid transition towards electric vehicles, leading to an increased export of fuels. On the other hand, countries beyond Russia are processing Russian crude oil in their refineries, effectively undermining the impact of the European ban on Russian oil. As a result, there is heightened competition from Russian products being refined in countries such as India, Turkey, and Pakistan, which has considerably influenced global markets.

This competition has also been reflected in European refining margins, which have experienced a decline, with 2024 margins falling to USD 7.1 per barrel, a stark drop from USD 11.7 per barrel in 2023.

Alfred Stern responded by acknowledging the challenges faced last year, which included regulatory changes in various countries and new capacities coming online that affected margins negatively. He mentioned that the final investment decision (FID) for their SAF plant at Petrobrazi was made last year, with production slated to commence in 2028.

Michele Della Vigna from Goldman Sachs questioned the outlook for biofuel margins, expressing concerns about their evolution and inquiring whether the enthusiasm for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) opportunities remains intact. 

Alfred Stern responded by acknowledging the challenges faced last year, which included regulatory changes in various countries and new capacities coming online that affected margins negatively. He mentioned that the final investment decision (FID) for their SAF plant at Petrobrazi was made last year, with production slated to commence in 2028. Until then, there is anticipation that demand—driven by both regulatory support and voluntary choices—will increase, creating a potential market gap that the company intends to capitalize on.",1,1,1562,500,100,True,False,What is OMV's current debt level and financial leverage position in 2025?,False,,

The gas market is very transparent, so the gas storage levels are visible. Additionally, we need to report to the
regulator what the storages are. I don't think we have seen cases where the mandate was not fulfilled. So I don't

54," recontextualized_answer: In the context of OMV's gas storage operations, Reinhard Florey expressed that he is not particularly worried about net working capital fluctuations in the gas sector. The company operates the gas storage business profitably, with substantial returns on investments made into storage. While temporary increases in working capital may occur due to rising price levels, he emphasized that these are expected to normalize over time. 

Florey noted a strong variability between high and low storage levels, but his primary concern lies with the absence of favorable summer-winter spreads that would allow for profitable business operations. He explained that the company does not engage in storing cubic meters of gas unless they are forward sold, as a lack of margin or spread would preclude such action. Currently, OMV finds itself in a wait-and-see position, assessing how market conditions evolve.

Moreover, Florey reassured stakeholders that he does not foresee working capital becoming an undue burden. The fluctuations inherent in working capital mean that investments made will eventually balance out throughout the year; thus, it is a dynamic aspect of the business. Instead of relying on specific cut-off dates for quarterly or annual assessments, he emphasized the importance of focusing on the volume of forward sales and the resulting profits, as these factors are ultimately critical for the company's sustained success.

55," recontextualized_answer: Given the prevailing market conditions characterized by a strong swing between high and low storage levels, I hold particular concerns regarding the interplay between summer-winter spreads and our business operations. If these spreads do not yield a favorable business outlook, we find ourselves in a position where we cannot afford to store cubic meters without having secured forward sales. The absence of a margin, meaning no viable spread, means we cannot engage in forward selling. Currently, we are adopting a wait-and-see strategy, monitoring market developments with a sense of cautious optimism.

In this context, I do not perceive working capital as an added burden despite its inherent fluctuations. Whatever we invest in working capital is expected to return to us in the opposite direction throughout the year. Therefore, it operates as a reciprocal transaction; we cannot rely solely on a specific cut-off date, whether at the end of a quarter or year, as the definitive guidance for our business decisions. Instead, our focus must be on how much we can forward sell and the resultant profit generated from these transactions. 

This approach will be crucial as we navigate potential inquiries about our new gas portfolio. For instance, Paul Redman of Exane BNP Paribas raised an intriguing question regarding our strategy in light of not needing to rely on Gazprom volumes, particularly concerning the cost implications and the differences in contracts associated with buying from the spot market compared to existing Gazprom contracts.

Answer by Reinhard Florey:  
In response to your inquiry regarding the potential exposure to higher costs in our diversified gas portfolio, it’s important to clarify that our gas supply and trading business operates not primarily as a cost-centric model, but rather as a margin and arbitrage-driven strategy. Therefore, when we look at the specific margins and arbitrage opportunities available from Russian gas supplies, the financial implications may actually be less favorable than those associated with our current diversified gas portfolio. This perspective allows us to navigate the fluctuations in working capital without relying solely on fixed timeframes, like quarter-end or year-end evaluations, reinforcing that our focus remains on the amounts we can forward sell and the associated profits we can generate.

The expected growth in our renewable energy sector will further strengthen our financial outlook and contribute positively to our bottom line, especially since these ventures will undergo certain exemptions from legislation. Overall, we are confident that our operations in Romania will remain profitable and are not concerned about becoming a loss-making business.",1,1,1843,500,100,True,False,What is OMV's current debt level and financial leverage position in 2025?,False,,
62," recontextualized_answer: In the context of our broader strategy to enhance profitability amidst fluctuating electricity prices for households, we are actively engaging in both gas and electricity export activities. This approach not only supports the current business model but also paves the way for future expansion into renewable energy sources. The additional development of our electricity production capabilities, particularly through renewable initiatives like geothermal energy, is expected to yield valuable contributions to the electricity market. Furthermore, these efforts may allow us to undergo certain exemptions from legislation, reinforcing our confidence that this will not become a loss-making venture.

Question by Michele Della Vigna – Goldman Sachs:  
I wanted to start with geothermal. You seem to be quite satisfied with the first well drilled there. I was just wondering, how material do you think this business could become in terms of EBITDA contribution by, let's say, the end of the decade?

Answer by Alfred Stern:  
We have actually finished drilling the first of three wells for that initial pilot production, which will eventually supply around 20,000 households with geothermal energy through the district heating network of Vienna. This underscores our commitment to sustainable energy solutions, although it’s clear that the geothermal sector presents a long timeline to achieve market maturity.

Answer by Alfred Stern:
We have actually finished drilling the first of three wells for our initial pilot production, which is expected to supply geothermal energy to about 20,000 households through the district heating network of Vienna. This network currently connects around 400,000 households, and we aim to expand our supply of geothermal energy to approximately 200,000 households. To reach this target, we need to replicate the current development process about seven times. While this venture holds great promise, it will require careful planning, development work, and investment, and we intend to approach this expansion in a step-by-step manner. Fortunately, we have a strong partnership in place through our joint venture with Wien Energie, which manages the district heating network, positioning us to effectively scale our geothermal operations as we progress.

64," recontextualized_answer: The district heating network in Vienna currently connects approximately 400,000 households, and we are aiming to significantly expand the use of geothermal energy within this system. Our goal is to ramp up supply to around 200,000 households powered by geothermal sources. To achieve this ambitious target, we recognize that we will need to replicate our current efforts about seven times, which will require further development work and substantial investments. We are committed to progressing in a step-by-step manner to ensure a sustainable transition. One of our key advantages in this initiative is our strong partnership with Wien Energie, the operator of the district heating network. This joint venture affords us access to a wide array of households and enhances our potential for success in this venture. Looking ahead, we anticipate that by 2030, these sustainable projects, including our geothermal initiatives, will contribute approximately 20% to our total cash flows, reinforcing our commitment to renewable energy and sustainable growth.

**Reinhard Florey**

Thank you, Florian. Ladies and gentlemen, good morning, and thank you for joining us. In the first quarter of 2025, we observed a mixed macroeconomic environment, characterized by growing concerns over the global economic outlook, primarily driven by uncertainties surrounding U.S. trade policy. This unsettling backdrop influenced various markets, including commodities. Notably, oil experienced a broader sell-off, dipping to just below $70 per barrel in mid-February. However, it managed a moderate recovery by the end of the quarter, reflecting the complex dynamics at play. 

Meanwhile, European gas prices rallied during this period, driven by significant draws on inventories due to heightened demand. This trend was coupled with the volatility of refining indicator margins, which, despite showing some recovery compared to the preceding quarter, remained significantly lower than the strong performance observed in the previous year. As we move forward, it is crucial to navigate these evolving market conditions carefully.

78," recontextualized_answer: European gas prices experienced a rally by mid-February due to large draws on inventories fueled by elevated demand amidst a challenging macroeconomic backdrop. However, this uptick was short-lived as prices eased in the latter half of the quarter, driven by increased LNG inflows and a seasonal tapering off of demand. Meanwhile, the refining indicator margin exhibited significant volatility, with a modest recovery compared to the previous quarter. Despite this, it remains notably lower than the robust levels seen in the same quarter last year. In contrast, olefin indicator margins improved quarter-on-quarter, buoyed by stronger demand and tighter-than-expected supply resulting from outages at crackers and refineries.

Beri here, thanks for the question. From a strategic standpoint, our perspective on adding inorganically to our barrel production remains unchanged. However, it’s important to highlight that we are observing a significant shift in the market landscape. There’s a noticeable slowdown in M&A activities, particularly influenced by declining prices. This has resulted in a widening bid-ask spread between buyers and sellers, making negotiations more complex. Despite this, we remain committed to identifying potential assets that could enhance our existing portfolio and improve our cash flows. Our approach will continue to be thorough, as we carefully screen opportunities that may arise in this evolving market.

I have a couple of questions, particularly regarding the chemical side of your operations. In your earlier remarks, you noted that European cracker operating rates have seen a significant increase in Q1, approximately 10% quarter-on-quarter. Given the current challenges on the demand side, I’d like to understand how you foresee margins evolving in the second quarter. Additionally, with the decline in oil prices, how do you anticipate feedstock costs will change in Europe and within the regions where you operate? This context is crucial for assessing the performance of your joint venture entities, especially considering the scheduled turnaround in one of those ventures.

Yes. Thanks, Ram, for the question. Indeed, as we assess the challenges currently facing the market, we are observing a range of movements. Specifically, we note that there has been a slight decline in demand for refinery products, which presents a significant challenge. However, this is contrasted by emerging opportunities within the chemicals sector, which could potentially allow for increased volumes. 

This dynamic situation is underscored by developments we've already observed in the first quarter, where refinery margins have exhibited volatility but, overall, have remained stable enough to support our operational capacity.

As we examine the current challenges and opportunities in the market, it is evident that we have already witnessed significant developments in the first quarter. Although refinery margins have exhibited volatility, they have remained stable at levels that allow us to sustain our utilization effectively. Currently, we are averaging a refining margin of above $6, which positions us favorably for potential future growth. This stable margin is essential, especially as we navigate a shift in the refinery mix; during the first quarter, we noticed an increase in lower-end refinery outputs, leading to reduced margins overall. While middle distillates continue to face challenges—except for sustainable aviation fuels and kerosene—we must also recognize the promising opportunities emerging in the chemicals sector.

Yes, thanks, Alejandro. I'll start by addressing the second question regarding our balance sheet and leverage, and then I'll let someone else answer the first question. We have a very strong position at OMV and currently, we are confident about our financial stability. In light of the upcoming transaction involving Borouge, while it's true that we’ll be increasing our leverage, we don’t foresee the need to divest any businesses. We have already carried out a thorough streamlining of our portfolio, which positions us well to manage this increase in leverage. 

Moreover, the additional leverage that we anticipate from our equity injection into BGI is projected to be limited to EUR 1.6 billion, which is comfortably within our leverage target of 30%. We estimate that even after this transaction, our leverage rate will remain slightly above 20%. Thus, we are not currently considering major divestments, although normal portfolio evaluations and adjustments are part of our ongoing strategy.

Yes, thanks, Alejandro. I'll start by addressing the second question regarding our balance sheet and leverage, and then I'll let someone else answer the first question. We have a very strong position at OMV and currently, we are confident about our financial stability. In light of the upcoming transaction involving Borouge, while it's true that we’ll be increasing our leverage, we don’t foresee the need to divest any businesses. We have already carried out a thorough streamlining of our portfolio, which positions us well to manage this increase in leverage. 

Moreover, the additional leverage that we anticipate from our equity injection into BGI is projected to be limited to EUR 1.6 billion, which is comfortably within our leverage target of 30%.

Indeed, while addressing the broader topic of tariffs, I want to clarify that our exposure to tariffs in a narrow sense will be marginal for OMV. This is primarily due to our supply radius, which does not involve cross-continental trade or any significant international business operations. Our focus remains largely regional, which mitigates our risk. In fact, this global individual setup is advantageous as it allows us to navigate around potential tariff impacts effectively. Specifically regarding Nova Chemicals, which operates across both U.S. and Canadian assets, our in-depth due diligence and ongoing discussions have shown that, currently, products such as polyolefins are not being significantly impacted by tariffs between Canada and the U.S. This positions us favorably in terms of maintaining stability and minimizing risk in our operations.

Specifically regarding Nova Chemicals, which operates across both U.S. and Canadian assets, our in-depth due diligence and ongoing discussions have shown that, currently, products such as polyolefins are not being significantly impacted by tariffs between Canada and the U.S. This positions us favorably in terms of maintaining stability and minimizing risk in our operations.",1,1,1373,500,100,True,False,What is OMV's current debt level and financial leverage position in 2025?,False,,

Thank you, Florian. I have just one question. Given the current macroeconomic uncertainties, it's noteworthy that oil prices remain relatively robust, consistently holding above $60 per barrel. However, we are grappling with significant uncertainties surrounding future operational expenditure (OpEx) policies. Although you've chosen to maintain your 2025 capital expenditure (CapEx) plans for the time being, I am curious about what your contingency plan, or Plan B, entails in the event of a drastic downturn in oil prices, particularly if they were to plummet toward $40 per barrel. Therefore, I would like to understand how you envision flexibly adjusting your CapEx in a challenging environment.

In light of the ongoing discussions about oil prices and the macroeconomic uncertainties, it's important to consider our strategic planning. While the current situation sees oil prices remaining relatively healthy at above $60, we must remain vigilant. Should the market experience a significant downturn, like hypothetically falling to $40 per barrel, we recognize the necessity for effective contingency plans. This aligns with our company's proactive stance on risk management and preparedness. We are committed to evaluating various scenarios to ensure our resilience in the face of potential challenges.

Yes. Thanks, Matt. To elaborate on the topic of the floor dividend and its implications for OMV, the floor dividend for the entire PTI group is currently estimated at around USD 2.2 billion. Given the present circumstances and following the anticipated capital increase, OMV is projected to hold a share of approximately 46.9%. However, after the adjustment related to the capital increase, this share will likely decrease to about 43%. This adjustment translates to a net cash inflow for OMV of approximately USD 1 billion, which equates to around EUR 900 million according to the existing exchange rate. 

When we consider the overall consolidation, it's important to note that this inflow will effectively reflect as operating cash flow, with the net cash flow corresponding directly to the dividend.
