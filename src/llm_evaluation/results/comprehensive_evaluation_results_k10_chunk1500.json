The company has a strong financial position, with net debt being stable and remaining well below their target leverage ratio of 30%. This favorable situation is highlighted by their cash position of EUR 6.5 billion and EUR 4.2 billion in undrawn committed credit facilities. These indicators suggest that OMV is well-positioned to manage financial obligations while pursuing potential growth opportunities. Their approach to maintain a low leverage ratio reflects sound financial management, despite ongoing market volatility as noted in their statements during the conference call.",

        "OMV Q4 2024 Conference Call \u2013 Q&A Transcript; February 4, 2025 1\nOMV Q4 2024 Conference Call \u2013 Q&A Transcript\nOMV published its results for Q4 2024 on February 4, 2025. The investor and analyst conference call was broadcast\nas a live audio\u2013webcast at 11:30 am CET. Below is the transcript of the question and answer session, by topic,\nedited for clarity.\nOMV Group 1\nDividend 1\nM&A 1\nChemicals 3\nMargins 3\nCAPEX 3\nUtilization rates 4\nInventory effects 4\nBorouge 4 4\nBaystar 5\nFuels & Feedstock 5\nRefining margins 5\nRenewable fuels 5\nEnergy 6\nGas supply 6\nGas storage 6\nGas & Power\nEastern Europe 7\nLow Carbon 7\nOMV Group\nDividend\nQuestion by Sasikanth Chilukuru \u2013 Morgan Stanley:\nHow do you decide upon the dividend payout relative to CFFO? This year is 28%, last year 29%. I recognize these are\nsmall differences but at a 30% CFFO payout, you could have kept the dividend flat year-on-year as well. So, I was\njust wondering what factors do you look into? Slightly related to this, the year-on-year growth rate of the regular\ndividend is also lower at 3.5% this year compared to 5% last year. Again, what does the slowdown in the growth rate\nof the regular dividend imply? Is this a sustainable growth rate that we can think of under current circumstances\nand the current macro environment?\nAnswer by Reinhard Florey:\nRegarding the dividends, the percentage that we chose in the range of 20% to 30% once again is a very high",
        "At around EUR 1.4 billion cash flow from operating activities was strong, rising by 32% compared with the previous quarter. However, it was 26% below the very strong first quarter of last year, which had benefited from a higher result and higher dividends from ADNOC Refining. Net working capital effects were around neutral. The organic cash flow from investing activities was around EUR 1 billion, mainly related to ordinary ongoing business investments and major growth projects such as NextonDeep, the PDH plant in Belgium and the sorting plant in Germany.\n\nAs a result, the organic free cash flow before dividends for the first quarter of 2025 came in at EUR 441 million. Our balance sheet remained very strong. Net debt was stable and our leverage ratio stayed low at 12%. At the end of March, OMV had a cash position of EUR 6.5 billion and EUR 4.2 billion in undrawn committed credit facilities. Looking ahead, we anticipate that volatility will persist, driven by uncertainties surrounding the outcome of ongoing tariff discussions and the Ukraine peace talks, which significantly limit our visibility. We do not expect to be directly impacted by the import tariffs and our operations are less export oriented. We primarily produce and sell regionally. However, tariffs will influence the global economic environment and this will, in turn, have an impact on OMV.",
        "These transactions create immediate value for OMV as they are free cash flow and clean CCS EPS accretive. At the same time, OMV maintains its investment-grade credit rating and keeps its leverage ratio well below 30%. The combined strength of the 3 companies will position Borouge Group International well to generate attractive shareholder returns. We expect a lower dividend net to OMV of around $1 billion per year, which will further strengthen OMV's shareholder distributions. We anticipate completing both transactions by the end of the first quarter 2026. The OMV Supervisory Board has also given its approval.\n\nAs is customary, closing the transaction is subject to the relevant regulatory approvals. In this case, merger control clearances in markets where the companies sell their products and foreign direct investment clearances in Austria, Canada and the U.S. Until completion, Borealis and Borouge will continue to pay dividends according to their current schedules and commitments.\n\nIn Romania, we have reached another major milestone. We have commenced drilling operations at the Neptun Deep project located to 160 kilometers offshore in the Black Sea. The project is progressing very well according to plan and within budget with first gas estimated for 2027. Neptun Deep, the largest offshore gas project in the European Union will add around 70,000 barrels today to our portfolio. In addition, OMV Petrom is advancing exploration activities in the Black Sea at offshore block.",
        "Florian Greger\n\nThanks a lot, Ram, for your questions. We now come to Alejandro Vigil, Santander.\n\nAlejandro Vigil\n\nThe first question would be about the ADNOC refining and trading. If you can elaborate about this weak performance you mentioned during the call, if it's more driven by trading less opportunities or it's more on the refining side?\n\nAnd the second question is about -- of course, you have a very strong balance sheet, but you're going to increase also leverage with the transaction of Borouge If you are planning some divestments as part of your plan for the coming years to offset this increase in leverage.\n\nReinhard Florey\n\nYes. Thanks, Alejandro. Maybe I'll start with the second question and pass on to for the first question to answer. Regarding the balance sheet and regarding the leverage -- we are still very confident and see a very strong position of OMV. There is no need for us to divest a business as we have already streamlined our portfolio.\n\nAnd we are seeing that the additional leverage that we have from the equity injection into BGI will be limited to EUR 1.6 million -- only EUR 1.5 billion, and that is easily within the frame that we have of our leverage target of 30%. We estimate that even after that, we will only be at a leverage rate slightly above 20%. So therefore, there is nothing that we are considering at the moment in terms of major divestments, although the reasonable rendations of our portfolio are normal course of business that will take on.",
        "This presentation does not contain any recommendation or invitation to buy or sell securities in OMV. I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Florian Greger, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Mr. Greger.\n\nFlorian Greger\n\nThank you. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to OMV's earnings call for the first quarter 2025.\n\nWith me on the call are our CFO, Reinhard Florey; Martijn van Koten, Executive Vice President, Fuels & Feedstock and Chemicals; and Beri Gaso, Executive Vice President, Energy. Our CEO, Alfred Stern, sends his regards. He is hosting a high-ranking government delegation that is visiting us today and, therefore, cannot participate in today's call. Reinhard will walk you through the highlights of the quarter and will discuss OMV's financial performance. Following his presentation, the gentlemen are available to answer your questions.\n\nAnd with that, I'll hand it over to Reinhard.\n\nReinhard Florey\n\nThank you, Florian. And ladies and gentlemen, good morning, and thank you for joining us. In the first quarter of 2025, the macro environment showed a mix picture with growing concerns about the global economic outlook driven by uncertainties surrounding U.S. trade policy. Oil was part of a broader sell-off, which starts to brief you bit below $70 per barrel in mid-February before posting moderate recovery at the end of the quarter.",
        "And then, of course, it's net working capital. Net working capital is a little bit of a buffer factor that we have when oil prices and margins would come down. So you would see that immediately also the level of net working capital dropping and releasing some of that net working capital into cash, providing a certain reserve and security for the balance sheet but we also have these kind of active responses in our plants. And this is, of course, something we are considering that we are rather currently seeing the span between $60 and $70 with the full year more towards the $70 still then thinking about the $40 of oil price environment as of yet.\n\nFlorian Greger\n\nWe now come to Matt Smith, Bank of America.\n\nMatt Smith\n\nTwo questions from me, please. The first is just a clarification on the Borouge Group International floor dividend, and that was just a simple clarification whether the full dividend or at least to OMV was the -- whether it was 90% of net income, whether that represents the floor or whether it was the EUR 2.2 billion total amount that translated to USD 1 billion to OMV. So that was a simple clarification on the BGI dividend?",
        "And then secondly, I wanted to come on to the chemicals margins not sort of current and certain environment actually thrown up some opportunities. And I think you noted some improvements in some chemical spreads in April, but just wanted to I wondered if you could touch on some of the drivers there, please understand those opportunities. What do you think is driving that and therefore, help us think about the sustainability of that, please?\n\nReinhard Florey\n\nYes. Thanks, Matt. Regarding the floor dividend, just to explain in some more detail. The floor dividend for the whole group of PTI is around USD 2.2 billion. Then according to the current situation, OMV would be entitled a share of 46.9% after the anticipated capital increase, this will rather be a share of around 43%. This will then translate into around USD 1 billion or according to the exchange rate around EUR 900 million. That is a net cash inflow to OMV.\n\nAnd whenever you see the consolidation, you would see more or less the operating cash flow being the net cash flow and the net cash flow being the dividend. That is how the nonconsolidated or equity consolidated method that we will have then the BGI group, including in this transaction.",
        "countries and some capacities coming on stream. The FID that we took on our SAF plant [in Petrobrazi] was last\nyear, so we are planning to come into production in 2028.

      "question": "What were OMV's Q4 2024 financial results and key performance indicators?",
      "generated_answer": "As per the Q4 2024 financial conference call, OMV reported a clean CCS operating result of approximately EUR 1.2 billion, which represented a 22% decline compared to the same quarter in the prior year and a 16% decrease from Q3 2024. Cash flow from operating activities was strong, totalling around EUR 1.4 billion, marking a 32% increase from the previous quarter, although it was still 26% lower than the robust first quarter of the previous year. The company maintained a solid balance sheet, with a stable net debt and a low leverage ratio at 12%. Furthermore, OMV's organic free cash flow before dividends was reported at EUR 441 million for Q1 2025. This financial stability, along with a cash position of EUR 6.5 billion and EUR 4.2 billion in undrawn committed credit facilities, reflects a strong standing, even amid a challenging macroeconomic climate characterized by uncertainties surrounding trade policies and the energy market.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "OMV's Q4 2025 financial results and key performance indicators (KPIs) are summarized below based on the provided data: Financial Performance Highlights (Q4 2025): Clean CCS Operating Result: ~EUR 1.2 billion, down 22% YoY (vs. Q4 2024) and 16% QoQ (vs. Q3 2025). Decline mainly due to the absence of arbitration-related gains in gas marketing/power seen in Q4 2024. Clean CCS EPS: EUR 1.26. Cash Flow from Operating Activities: ~EUR 1.4 billion, up 30%+ from Q3 2025, indicating strong cash generation despite lower production. Key Operational KPIs: Polyolefin Sales Volumes (including JVs): up 10% YoY. Fuel Sales Volumes: Remained broadly stable. Hydrocarbon Production: down 12% YoY due to Malaysian asset divestment. European Crackers Utilization Rate: up 3 percentage points to 90%. Base Chemicals Business declined due to lower inventory valuation effects, decreased stock advantage, and higher customer discounts. Polyolefins Segment lower performance from higher fixed costs and lower realized margins. Dividend & Capital Structure: Regular Dividend Increased by EUR 0.10, continuing the progressive dividend policy. Payout ratio remains in the 20%\u201330% range, near the upper end, reflecting confidence and commitment to shareholder returns. Net Debt & Leverage: Leverage ratio well below 30% (specifically noted as 12% at the end of Q1 2025). Cash Position (as of end-Q1 2025): EUR 6.5 billion. Undrawn Credit Facilities: EUR 4.2 billion. Investment & Strategic Moves: Organic free cash flow before dividends (Q1 2025): EUR 441 million. Ongoing major investments: NextonDeep, PDH plant (Belgium), sorting plant (Germany). Divestments: Malaysian assets (impacted hydrocarbon production). Future Outlook: Expect polyolefin volumes to reach ~4.1 million tonnes in 2025 (excluding JVs). Tariff impacts on chemical markets still uncertain.",

        "Regarding the dividends, the percentage that we chose in the range of 20% to 30% once again is a very high percentage. So it is in the upper end of the upper half of the range and the difference to the payout ratio in last year is only in the decimals. So therefore, we see that this is actually a signal of strength, a signal of confidence that we",
        "have, that in spite of many challenges that we see in the economic environment, we are rewarding our shareholders as we promised and keep the payout ratio at the upper end of the range. When it comes to the increase of the regular dividend with our progressive dividend policy, again, we kept our promise to increase. And we increased that by EUR 0.10. And again, this is not much different than last year. If you put it in percentages, yes, it's slightly lower, but that has a reason. The reason actually is that, of course, the higher you get, the more important it is to also keep a certain balance between the additional variable dividend and the regular dividend.",
        "The clean operating results of Energy segment declined by EUR 142 million to EUR 910 million as a better E&P result could not compensate for the lower gas marketing and power contribution. The performance of E&P improved, driven by positive market effects of around EUR 14 million. Gas prices rose significantly compared with the first quarter of 2024, while oil prices decreased.",

Perhaps what could that contribution look like?\nAnswer by Reinhard Florey:\nOur path to profitability is very clear: It is first getting the operations stable. This means we have made significant\nprogress on the cracker facility. We are, as we speak, making significant progress also on the polyethylene plant.\nThe polyethylene plant will undergo a maintenance window in the first quarter where we are implementing\nadditional optimizations on the operations. In addition to this operational optimization, we look at the commercial",
        "And then, of course, it's net working capital. Net working capital is a little bit of a buffer factor that we have when oil prices and margins would come down. So you would see that immediately also the level of net working capital dropping and releasing some of that net working capital into cash, providing a certain reserve and security for the balance sheet but we also have these kind of active responses in our plants. And this is, of course, something we are considering that we are rather currently seeing the span between $60 and $70 with the full year more towards the $70 still then thinking about the $40 of oil price environment as of yet.\n\nFlorian Greger\n\nWe now come to Matt Smith, Bank of America.\n\nMatt Smith\n\nTwo questions from me, please. The first is just a clarification on the Borouge Group International floor dividend, and that was just a simple clarification whether the full dividend or at least to OMV was the -- whether it was 90% of net income, whether that represents the floor or whether it was the EUR 2.2 billion total amount that translated to USD 1 billion to OMV. So that was a simple clarification on the BGI dividend?"

      "question": "How was the performance of OMV's chemicals business? Were there any new investments for profitability?",
      "generated_answer": "OMV's chemicals business showed signs of resilience amid a challenging market environment. In April, there were improvements in chemical spreads, suggesting an uptick in the profitability of this segment. The company has identified several strategic investments aimed at enhancing profitability. Notably, ongoing projects such as the PDH plant in Belgium and the sorting plant in Germany are fundamental to its growth strategy. These investments are critical as they not only reinforce OMV's position in polyolefins but also leverage feedstock advantages in key markets. Furthermore, the strategic partnership with ADNOC will likely provide substantial synergies, enhancing operational efficiencies and profitability in the long run. This combination of strategic investments and collaborative efforts with ADNOC is expected to drive sustainable growth within OMV's chemicals business. Overall, while performance may be impacted by external factors like global economic uncertainty, OMV's proactive investment strategy positions it favorably for improved profitability in the chemicals sector.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "OMV's chemicals business in the first quarter of 2025 showed broadly stable performance compared to the same period in 2024, with some positive operational and market developments, but also challenges impacting profitability. Performance highlights: Clean Operating Result was \u20ac126 million \u2014 almost flat compared to Q1 2024. European Business benefited from positive market effects (\u20ac57 million), primarily due to rising olefin indicator margins. Inventory effects were still positive, but \u20ac11 million lower year-over-year. Cracker utilization rate improved from 87% to 90%. Borealis (excluding JVs) contribution declined to \u20ac71 million, impacted by lower inventory valuation effects, decreased like stock advantage, higher customer discounts, higher fixed costs and lower realized polyolefin margins. Polyolefins sales volumes (excluding JVs) increased by 11%. Growth was driven by consumer products and infrastructure, while mobility segment declined in line with market conditions. Joint Ventures (e.g., Borouge) contribution increased to \u20ac45 million, thanks to higher Borouge sales volumes and exclusion of Baystar's result starting in March. This was partially offset by lower polyethylene prices in Asia. Reclassification Gain: One-time positive impact of ~\u20ac40 million from reclassifying Borealis as an asset held for sale, following the March 3 agreement to combine Borealis and Borouge shareholdings into Borouge Group International.",

OMV and ADNOC have signed a binding agreement to combine Borealis and Borouge along with the simultaneous acquisition of Nova Chemicals to form a new company Group International.",
        "Let me now return to the performance of our business segments in the first quarter of this year.

The contribution of Borealis excluding joint ventures, declined to EUR 71 million. The base chemicals business decreased considerably as higher olefin indicator margins were more than offset by lower inventory valuation effects, a decreased like stock advantage and higher customer discounts. Polyolefins came in lower",
        "as well, mainly as a result of higher fixed costs and lower realized margins.",
        "We were able to expand polyolefin sales volumes, excluding joint ventures by 11%. Sales volumes in the consumer products and infrastructure industries increased as more demand was captured, while sales volumes in the mobility industry declined in line with the market sentiment. The contribution of the joint ventures grew to EUR 45 million, mainly due to better Borouge performance and the exclusion of Baystar's result from the clean operating result effective of March",
        "Overall, the result was positively impacted by around EUR 40 million due to a reclassification of Borealis as an asset held for sale following the signing of the transaction on March 3 to combine the shareholdings of Borealis and Borouge into Borouge Group International."

However, it was 26% below the very strong first quarter of last year, which had benefited from a higher result and higher dividends from ADNOC Refining. Net working capital effects were around neutral. The organic cash flow from investing activities was around EUR 1 billion, mainly related to ordinary ongoing business investments and major growth projects such as NextonDeep, the PDH plant in Belgium and the sorting plant in Germany.\n\nAs a result, the organic free cash flow before dividends for the first quarter of 2025 came in at EUR 441 million. Our balance sheet remained very strong. Net debt was stable and our leverage ratio stayed low at 12%. At the end of March, OMV had a cash position of EUR 6.5 billion and EUR 4.2 billion in undrawn committed credit facilities. Looking ahead, we anticipate that volatility will persist, driven by uncertainties surrounding the outcome of ongoing tariff discussions and the Ukraine peace talks, which significantly limit our visibility. We do not expect to be directly impacted by the import tariffs and our operations are less export oriented. We primarily produce and sell regionally. However, tariffs will influence the global economic environment and this will, in turn, have an impact on OMV.",

What do you think is driving that and therefore, help us think about the sustainability of that, please?\n\nReinhard Florey\n\nYes. Thanks, Matt. Regarding the floor dividend, just to explain in some more detail. The floor dividend for the whole group of PTI is around USD 2.2 billion. Then according to the current situation, OMV would be entitled a share of 46.9% after the anticipated capital increase, this will rather be a share of around 43%. This will then translate into around USD 1 billion or according to the exchange rate around EUR 900 million. That is a net cash inflow to OMV.\n\nAnd whenever you see the consolidation, you would see more or less the operating cash flow being the net cash flow and the net cash flow being the dividend.

We anticipate completing both transactions by the end of the first quarter 2026. The OMV Supervisory Board has also given its approval.\n\nAs is customary, closing the transaction is subject to the relevant regulatory approvals. In this case, merger control clearances in markets where the companies sell their products and foreign direct investment clearances in Austria, Canada and the U.S. Until completion, Borealis and Borouge will continue to pay dividends according to their current schedules and commitments.\n\nIn Romania, we have reached another major milestone. We have commenced drilling operations at the Neptun Deep project located to 160 kilometers offshore in the Black Sea. The project is progressing very well according to plan and within budget with first gas estimated for 2027.

        "Florian Greger\n\nThanks a lot, Ram, for your questions. We now come to Alejandro Vigil, Santander.\n\nAlejandro Vigil\n\nThe first question would be about the ADNOC refining and trading. If you can elaborate about this weak performance you mentioned during the call, if it's more driven by trading less opportunities or it's more on the refining side?\n\nAnd the second question is about -- of course, you have a very strong balance sheet, but you're going to increase also leverage with the transaction of Borouge If you are planning some divestments as part of your plan for the coming years to offset this increase in leverage.\n\nReinhard Florey\n\nYes. Thanks, Alejandro. Maybe I'll start with the second question and pass on to for the first question to answer. Regarding the balance sheet and regarding the leverage -- we are still very confident and see a very strong position of OMV. There is no need for us to divest a business as we have already streamlined our portfolio.\n\nAnd we are seeing that the additional leverage that we have from the equity injection into BGI will be limited to EUR 1.6 million -- only EUR 1.5 billion, and that is easily within the frame that we have of our leverage target of 30%. We estimate that even after that, we will only be at a leverage rate slightly above 20%. So therefore, there is nothing that we are considering at the moment in terms of major divestments, although the reasonable rendations of our portfolio are normal course of business that will take on.",
        "The new company will be the fourth largest polyolefin player globally with access to the largest, most attractive and fastest-growing markets across the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Asia. It will benefit from a highly competitive cost position with around 70% of its production capacity in feedstock advantaged regions, complemented by a best-in-class specialties business. Following a EUR 1.6 billion cash injection into the new OMV will hold a 36.9% stake in Borouge Group International with equal shareholdings and joint control with ADNOC. Borouge Group International will serve as a substantial platform for organic growth in polyolefins, supported by a robust pipeline of near-term projects. Borouge Group International has tremendous growth potential through the cycle with EBITDA projected to exceed USD 7 billion.

      "question": "How did Ukraine's war impact OMV's business? Has there a been gradual decline in perfromance of any of divisions over the multiple quarters?",
      "generated_answer": "The war in Ukraine has had a significant impact on OMV's business, primarily through disruptions in gas supply and increased market volatility. The halt in gas flows through the Ukrainian pipeline to Europe has led to challenges in maintaining adequate gas storage levels, with OMV reporting that their storage capacity was notably lower compared to the previous year. This disruption has likely affected OMV's operations, particularly in the Energy segment, which experienced a decline in clean operating results, attributed to reduced contributions from gas marketing and power. \n\nOver multiple quarters, it appears there has been a gradual decline in performance metrics, particularly in gas marketing and power, where significant reductions were noted. For instance, the company recorded a decrease of EUR 142 million in clean operating results, largely influenced by adverse market conditions and lower sales volumes due to the geopolitical situation. Additionally, while OMV has diversified its gas supply to mitigate risks associated with reliance on single suppliers, the overall market environment and uncertainties\u2014exacerbated by ongoing conflict and tariff discussions\u2014have likely contributed to fluctuations in performance across various divisions. The complexities of operating in such a volatile climate call for continuous monitoring and strategic adjustments to navigate these challenges successfully.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "1. Increased Market Volatility and Uncertainty: Peace talks in Ukraine are cited as a source of ongoing uncertainty that limits OMV's visibility into future performance. OMV acknowledges that even though they may not be directly impacted by import tariffs, the global economic ripple effects caused by geopolitical instability\u2014such as the war in Ukraine\u2014are influencing their operations. 2. Pressure on Refining Margins (ADNOC Division): The ADNOC refining division appears to be experiencing a gradual deterioration in performance. Key contributing factors include: Drop in local refining margins, due in part to: Crowded export markets, increased competition from Chinese refineries, electric vehicle adoption reducing domestic fuel demand, and Russian crude being processed in non-EU countries (India, Turkey, Pakistan), circumventing the European ban and re-entering the global supply, increasing competition and downward pressure on margins. This clearly indicates a gradual decline in the ADNOC refining segment over multiple quarters, exacerbated by shifts in global supply chains due to the Ukraine conflict. 3. Diversified Gas Portfolio Shift: OMV's gas supply and trading business moved from reliance on Russian gas arbitrage to a more diversified portfolio. They indicate that margins from this diversified approach may actually be better than those from earlier reliance on Russian gas. This suggests a strategic pivot rather than performance degradation, though it was prompted by disruptions following the Ukraine invasion. 4. Financial Resilience Despite Challenges: Despite the geopolitical and market pressures, OMV reports organic free cash flow of EUR 441 million in Q1 2025. Net debt remained stable, and leverage is low (12%). OMV holds a strong liquidity position (EUR 6.5B cash, EUR 4.2B undrawn facilities). This implies that while certain divisions like refining are struggling, the company as a whole has maintained financial strength, helped in part by its regional business focus and diversification strategy.",

We see, on the one hand side, more pressure from Chinese refineries, while the domestic market, specifically when it comes to vehicles, has been conquered at a quite significant pace with electric vehicles. And therefore, fuels are being increasingly exported. On the other side, countries outside of Russia, are processing Russian crude in refineries. And the ban that we see in Europe did not",

Or would you consider it too big a risk?\nAnswer by Alfred Stern:\nGazprom committed multiple, fundamental contract violations which caused OMV significant damage in 2022. We\ninitiated arbitration proceedings against Gazprom in the beginning of 2023 for which we received awards, including\ndamage awards, at the end of last year. We then offset these damage awards against open payments for gas\nsupplies in Austria. And as a consequence of this, Gazprom ceased the supply, which was both a contractual and a\nlegal violation, to which we then had to react to and terminated the gas supply contract.\nAs you know in the gas market, being able to count on reliable supplies through long-term gas contracts is a key\nprerequisite. And through those multiple contract violations, that was no longer a given with Gazprom for OMV, and\nthat was the reason why we terminated the contract. We did not terminate the contract because of sanctions or\nany laws against Russian gas, and still to this date, there are no sanctions or laws against Russian gas supplies.\nHowever, OMV has learned that relying on a single gas supplier was not a good idea, and this is why we diversified\nour gas supplies.

        "The clean operating results of Energy segment declined by EUR 142 million to EUR 910 million as a better E&P result could not compensate for the lower gas marketing and power contribution. The performance of E&P improved, driven by positive market effects of around EUR 14 million. Gas prices rose significantly compared with the first quarter of 2024, while oil prices decreased.\n\nProduction volumes declined by 42,000 barrels per day, primarily due to the divestment of the Malaysian assets and natural decline in Norway and New Zealand, partially offset by increased output in media. Production costs increased slightly to $10.1 per barrel due to lower production volumes. Sales volumes decreased in line with production, also impacted by the lifting schedule in Norway and The result of gas marketing and power declined sharply by EUR 102 million, with reductions seen both in east and west. The gas waste result amounted to EUR 120 million, mostly driven by a lower storage results due to decreased summer weaker spreads, partially offset by arbitration award of roughly EUR 50 million for the Austrian supply contract with staining negative, down by EUR 104 million compared to the first quarter 2024, which was primarily due to the change in legislation for the gas and power sector in Romania, which came into effect in April 2024.",
        "Florian Greger\n\nI was just notified that the next in line dropped. I know it's a very busy reporting day. Currently, there is no other people in the line asking questions. So if you have a follow-up question, you I just hear that there is a follow-up from Josh.\n\nJosh Stone\n\nI thought I'd keep going. On to about tariffs, you mentioned no direct impact or very minimal impact on OMV. Can you maybe just expand on Nova Chemicals and going through the scenarios on that, given they have both U.S. and Canadian assets, it's quite difficult for us to understand what potential impact that might be? And I'm sure you did a lot of audit on that. So maybe you could just talk about that, that would be helpful.\n\nReinhard Florey\n\nIndeed, in a general note, the exposure to tariffs as we see it in the narrow sense will be marginal to OMV. The reason simply is that with our supply radius that we have, both on the upstream side and the downstream side. We are not in a cross-continental trade or any cross continental business. On the other hand, when it comes to we are seeing that this global individual setup as such, will rather help to avoid being exposed to tariffs.",
        "countries and some capacities coming on stream. The FID that we took on our SAF plant [in Petrobrazi] was last\nyear, so we are planning to come into production in 2028. Until then we will see the demand, both from regulatory\nside and voluntary demand, pick up, so that there will be a short market position that we want to use.\nThe advantage as OMV is that in the corridor in which we are active, we are key supplier to some of the major\nairports, such as Munich, Vienna and Bucharest and we continue to expand our customer portfolio and access to\ndifferent airports to increase the demand side. You might remember that we announced various MoU which we\ncontinue to convert into sales contracts. We are definitely excited with regards to SAF demand. And with the\nmandates developing this year from 2% in Europe to 6% by 2030, and then 20% by 2035, we do believe that this will\nOMV Q4 2024 Conference Call \u2013 Q&A Transcript; February 4, 2025 6\nrepresent attractive markets to aim for. We are planning to supply more renewable fuel volumes, the biggest\nportion being SAF, then some biofuels, and then also chemical feedstock. And we think with this portfolio, we are in\na strong position to capture the market growth.\nEnergy\nGas supply\nQuestion by Henry Tarr \u2013 Berenberg:\nWould you be willing to sign another contract with Gazprom for gas supply if circumstances changed and the\nopportunity arose?

The investor and analyst conference call was broadcast\nas a live audio\u2013webcast at 11:30 am CET.

This year is 28%, last year 29%. I recognize these are\nsmall differences but at a 30% CFFO payout, you could have kept the dividend flat year-on-year as well. So, I was\njust wondering what factors do you look into? Slightly related to this, the year-on-year growth rate of the regular\ndividend is also lower at 3.5% this year compared to 5% last year. Again, what does the slowdown in the growth rate\nof the regular dividend imply? Is this a sustainable growth rate that we can think of under current circumstances\nand the current macro environment?\nAnswer by Reinhard Florey:\nRegarding the dividends, the percentage that we chose in the range of 20% to 30% once again is a very high",
        "This presentation does not contain any recommendation or invitation to buy or sell securities in OMV. I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Florian Greger, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Mr. Greger.\n\nFlorian Greger\n\nThank you. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to OMV's earnings call for the first quarter 2025.\n\nWith me on the call are our CFO, Reinhard Florey; Martijn van Koten, Executive Vice President, Fuels & Feedstock and Chemicals; and Beri Gaso, Executive Vice President, Energy. Our CEO, Alfred Stern, sends his regards. He is hosting a high-ranking government delegation that is visiting us today and, therefore, cannot participate in today's call. Reinhard will walk you through the highlights of the quarter and will discuss OMV's financial performance. Following his presentation, the gentlemen are available to answer your questions.\n\nAnd with that, I'll hand it over to Reinhard.\n\nReinhard Florey\n\nThank you, Florian. And ladies and gentlemen, good morning, and thank you for joining us. In the first quarter of 2025, the macro environment showed a mix picture with growing concerns about the global economic outlook driven by uncertainties surrounding U.S. trade policy. Oil was part of a broader sell-off, which starts to brief you bit below $70 per barrel in mid-February before posting moderate recovery at the end of the quarter.",
        "However, OMV has learned that relying on a single gas supplier was not a good idea, and this is why we diversified\nour gas supplies. I am of the opinion we now have the strongest gas portfolio that we ever had because it's\ndiversified across our own production and third-party suppliers through pipelines from Norway, from Italy, and LNG\nsupplies from the U.S., i.e. internationally etc.\nGas storage\nQuestion by Giacomo Romeo \u2013 Jefferies:\nI think your storage capacity is now close to the level you had at the exit of winter last year. Obviously, wintersummer spreads we've seen do not support injection. What's your plan for injection this year on this basis? What is\nthe actual enforcement mechanism in place to make sure that the 90% is reached if the winter summer spreads\nremain negative?\nAnswer by Alfred Stern:\nWe are currently at about a 65%-67% gas storage level. One year ago it was above 80%. And I think that's a result of\nmultiple things. Firstly, the winter this year is colder than it was last year. Or put the other way around, last year was\nan even more unusually warm winter with less gas demand. And secondly, the flows through the Ukrainian pipeline\nto Europe stopped. Those two things have led to a situation where the storage is being depleted. And as you know\nthere are some storage mandates, i.e. minimum filling requirements that we will need to fulfill. And we are currently"
