This year is 28%, last year 29%. I recognize these are<br>small differences but at a 30% CFFO payout, you could have kept the dividend flat year-on-year as well. So, I was<br>just wondering what factors do you look into? Slightly related to this, the year-on-year growth rate of the regular<br>dividend is also lower at 3.5% this year compared to 5% last year. Again, what does the sl</span><span style="background-color: #a57070;" title="Chunk 0 | Start: 0 | End: 1356 | Tokens: 383 (Overlap)">owdown in the growth rate<br>of the regular dividend imply?

Is this a sustainable growth rate that we can think of under current circumstances<br>and the current macro environment?<br>Answer by Reinhard Florey:<br>Regarding the dividends, the percentage that we chose in the range of 20% to 30% once again is a very high<br>percentage. So it is in the upper end of the upper half of the range and the difference to the payout ratio in last year<br>is only in the decimals. So therefore, we see that this is actually a signal of strength, a signal of confidence that we<br>have, that in spite of many challenges that we see in the economic environment, we are rewarding our shareholders<br>as we promised and keep the payout ratio at the upper end of the range.<br>When it comes to the increase of the regular dividend with our progressive dividend policy, again, we kept our<br>promise to increase. And we increased that by EUR 0.10. And again, this is not much different than last year. If you<br>put it in percentages, yes, it&#x27;s slightly lower, but that has a reason. The reason actually is that, of course, the higher<br>you get, the more important it is to als</span><span style="background-color: #a58b6b;" title="Chunk 1 | Start: 1116 | End: 2736 | Tokens: 350 (Overlap)">o keep a certain balance between the additional variable dividend and the<br>regular dividend.<br>So it is important to send this message that while we introduced three years ago the additional variable element by<br>calling it at that time a special dividend. </span><span style="background-color: #FDFFB6;" title="Chunk 2 | Start: 2484 | End: 4116 | Tokens: 363">We continued to pay this and we continue to make that a reliable element<br>as long as we are below the 30% leverage threshold – from which we are far away currently.

We continued to pay this and we continue to make that a reliable element<br>as long as we are below the 30% leverage threshold – from which we are far away currently. And this is important.<br>And therefore, it&#x27;s also important to give this a certain weight and not cut too much by increasing the progressive<br>regular dividend.

And this is the way we want to keep it.<br>M&amp;A<br>Question by Joshua Stone – UBS:<br>Could you expand a little bit on the potential acquisition of Nova Chemicals. What is it about this business that<br>makes it attractive to OMV? When I look at the assets, it&#x27;s not that much specialty in the mix.

And that joint venture should be a joint growth<br>platform for next steps of which potentially we are now considering Nova being such a step.<br>This would create a top global company and additional synergies and we would be strengthening the polyolefin<br>position through this addition. And as you point out, a strong feedstock portfolio would be there. As we are still in<br>ongoing negotiationering Nova being such a step.<br>This would create a top global company and additional synergies and we would be strengthening the polyolefin<br>position through this addition. And as you point out, a strong feedstock portfolio would be there. As we are still in<br>ongoing negotiations, I want to refrain from speculating of what the outcome of this could be. I just want to<br>emphasize, we are in ongoing and open-ended negotiations and it will require that we find an agreement also with<br>ADNOC. And in relation to Nova, there is also the requirement that an agreement is found with Mubdala, as the<br>current owner.<br>Question by Matthew Smith – Bank of America</span><span style="background-color: #83a57c;" title="Chunk 3 | Start: 3840 | End: 5532 | Tokens: 355 (Overlap)">:<br>Could you touch upon the timing of Nova Chemicals and the sort of logic for attempting to include the entity at this<br>point in time?

And I think the strategic direction of the potential joint venture is of key importance. We have always said that<br>combination needs to be a growth platform for polyolefins and drive that further to become a key player in this<br>market. We believe Nova would be a good strategic fit as it would strengthen the JV&#x27;s position in particular in North<br>America. It would further enhance the feedstock position and also allow to extract additional synergies. So again,<br>there&#x27;s a good compelling industrial logic to potentially include Nova as ana good strategic fit as it would strengthen the JV&#x27;s position in particular in North<br>America. It would further enhance the feedstock position and also allow to extract additional synergies. So again,<br>there&#x27;s a good compelling industrial logic to potentially include Nova as an inorganic growth opportunity.

We have communicated in our strategy and we maintain the goal of 350 kboe/d in 2030. Now, we are<br>working diligently on Neptun Deep that will increase the production again. I&#x27;ve also talked about Austria&#x27;s smaller<br>Wittau, and then Haydn-Monn in Norway. We will drive those forward.

And with quite a<br>few new polyethylene projects starting up, particularly in China, I was just wondering if you can think there is supply<br>side risk where you possibly see some further pressure on prices or margins for polyolefins.<br>Answer by Alfred Stern:<br>For 2025 we should at least be at the polyolefin margin level of last year, i.e. for both polyethylene and<br>polypropylene above EUR 400/t. Our sales volumes at Borealis, including the sales from joint ventures, will go up by<br>another 200 kt to 4.1 mn t. As I highlighted in my speech, it&#x27;s actually q</span><span style="background-color: #7a73a5;" title="Chunk 6 | Start: 7944 | End: 9624 | Tokens: 368 (Overlap)">uite amazing that we were able to grow<br>volumes by 10% last year, which shows quite some recovery in addition to recoverys, including the sales from joint ventures, will go up by<br>another 200 kt to 4.1 mn t.

With the high percentage of specialty sales that Borealis has, this<br>growth was across specialty and productivity sales. So across all the different segments, which I see as a positive<br>sign. At a minimum, we will be above EUR 400/t in 2025.<br>CAPEX<br>Question by Joshua Stone – UBS:<br>On the slowdown of circular chemicals, which you&#x27;ve linked to weaker regulation and less certain environments in<br>Europe. But in practice, what does this mean for your [Organic] CAPEX plan over the next five years? Because you&#x27;ve<br>allocated around 15% to sustainable chemicals. So how much of that comes out in your view, and which projects are<br>most likely impacted?<br>Answer by Alfred Stern:<br>The slowdown on the circular is quite simply explained. I think the introduction of the Packaging Waste Directive<br>was delayed in the EU and the transposition into the national laws was de</span><span style="background-color: #a580a5;" title="Chunk 7 | Start: 9372 | End: 10944 | Tokens: 363 (Overlap)">layed, and this is of course creating a delay<br>then in the entire market change. We remain focused on driving forward our activities in the circular economy and<br>we believe with our ReOil® technology, we have a very strong technology that allows us to capture the be</span><span style="background-color: #FFADAD;" title="Chunk 8 | Start: 10680 | End: 12276 | Tokens: 362">nefits in<br>that market. However, it is important for us that we roll this out in synchronization of the market demand as it is<br>generated so that we can get the right returns for these projects. So, we will continue to push for thows us to capture the benefits in<br>that market. However, it is important for us that we roll this out in synchronization of the market demand as it is<br>generated so that we can get the right returns for these projects. So, we will continue to push for the same targets<br>but I think some of it will get delayed beyond 2030 to accommodate for this.<br>I want to end here with that we just finished building the 16 kt ReOil® plant here and that we are in the start-up<br>phase. We have actually been able to produce several hundred tons of pyrolysis oil which is the output, the circular<br>feedstock that we make. So we are making good progress on this and we are looking forward to bring this fully on<br>stream. And then also create the right co-operations there already on that 16 kt plant with a further look to the next<br>size plant to make sure that we </span><span style="background-color: #a57070;" title="Chunk 8 | Start: 10680 | End: 12276 | Tokens: 362 (Overlap)">can also get double-digit returns on those investments.<br>Question by Peter Low – Redburn:<br>The CAPEX guidance of EUR 3.6 bn seems a little bit below the guidance at the CMD that implied about<br>EUR 3.8 bn/yr in the coming years.

And if so, should we think that it remains at that slightly lower level going forward?<br>Answer by Reinhard Florey:<br>For 2025 we are proposing EUR 3.6 bn. We are seeing quite some challenges in the market where we want to keep a<br>very strong balance sheet, a very strong cash flow and therefore we will keep a strong discipline in the way how we<br>spend. CAPEX efficiency means that we try to be first of all selective and seare seeing quite some challenges in the market where we want to keep a<br>very strong balance sheet, a very strong cash flow and therefore we will keep a strong discipline in the way how we<br>spend.

That is part of our improvement program with more than EUR 500 mn cash flow impact of improvement<br>measures.

Could you describe<br>what&#x27;s driving that? Is this part of the de-stocking cycle ending and more customer demand, or is it technical<br>improvements at the crackers?<br>Answer by Alfred Stern:<br>One of the major drivers of the utilization rate is the ramp-up of our Baystar joint venture. We anticipate this to run<br>higher utilization rates allowing us to drive things forward and increase sales volumes. In addition, I do see somkers?<br>Answer by Alfred Stern:<br>One of the major drivers of the utilization rate is the ramp-up of our Baystar joint venture.

We saw a significant market<br>improvement last year, and expect a little bit more of a sideways movement this year that we can use with our<br>product portfolio.<br>I want to emphasize that, in additio</span><span style="background-color: #CAFFBF;" title="Chunk 11 | Start: 14664 | End: 16212 | Tokens: 354">n to our more commoditized products, we also have a strong presence in<br>specialty products across our portfolio. This includes areas where Borealis is the global market leader, such as the<br>energy wire and cable insulation market. We have attractive growth in these markets, supported by solid underlying<br>reasons. There are various programs and projects driving demand for these products.<br>Inventory effects<br>Question by Matthew Lofting – J.P. Morgan:<br>Could you talk about your perspectives on the stocking cycle. It seemed like that weakened in the year 2024. How<br>have you seen that in Q1 to-date, and what assumptions have you made specifically in the context of your outlook<br>and margins in Chemicals for 2025?<br>Answer by Alfred Stern:<br>Before 2024, we have seen a unique and very long de-stocking cycle, presumably an effect of multiple things<br>coming together such as COVID, broken supply chains and increased demand through COVID etc. This was over by<br>2024, and we were able to sell about 10% more volumes through Borealis in 2024 and even more in Q4/24 [yoy],<br>across all segments. ther such as</span><span style="background-color: #83a57c;" title="Chunk 11 | Start: 14664 | End: 16212 | Tokens: 354 (Overlap)"> COVID, broken supply chains and increased demand through COVID etc. This was over by<br>2024, and we were able to sell about 10% more volumes through Borealis in 2024 and even more in Q4/24 [yoy],<br>across all segments. I would see that as a po</span><span style="background-color: #9BF6FF;" title="Chunk 12 | Start: 15972 | End: 17532 | Tokens: 351">sitive signal, because in addition the margins improved, which in total<br>creates an even better picture. I would agree that the year-end is always influenced by working capital and storage<br>management. So for 2025, we are looking at margins that are at least above the EUR 400/t for polyethylene and<br>polypropylene. And additionally we see opportunities to sell higher volumes partly because of the ramp-up of, for<br>example, Baystar, but of course, also because of our view of the market.<br>Borouge 4<br>Question by Sasikanth Chilukuru – Morgan Stanley:<br>You reiterated that the Borouge 4 project will be re- contributed to Borouge from ADNOC and Borealis once<br>completed. If you were to single out this transaction, what value should we expect for the project? What is the<br>expected cash inflow? And when can we expect this to be done as well?<br>Answer by Reinhard Florey:<br>The concept of Borouge 4 to be recontributed to Borouge has nothing to do with a potential transaction between<br>Borealis and Borouge. Please understand that the project is still up and running and we cannot specify an exact<br>value of that.

Do you need to see a recovery in industry margins? Are there<br>operational improvements still to come there? Perhaps what could that contribution look like?<br>Answer by Reinhard Florey:<br>Our path to profitability is very clear: It is first getting the operations stable. This means we have made significant<br>progress on the cracker facility. We are, as we speak, making significant progress also on the polyethylene plant.<br>The polyethylene plant will undergo a maintenance window in the first quarter where we are implementing<br>additional optimizations on the operations. In addition to this operational optimization, we look at the commercial<br>side.

Could you talk a bit about what you think,<br>why the performance was weak and what you think the contribution can be for this year?<br>Answer by Reinhard Florey:<br>The ADNOC refining performance was clearly deteriorating as the local refining margins have dropped. The reason<br>are the crowded export markets in the refining business. We see, on the one hand side, more pressure from Chinese<br>refineries, while the domestic market, specifically when it comes to vehicles, has been conquered at a quite<br>si</span><span style="background-color: #7a73a5;" title="Chunk 14 | Start: 18576 | End: 20172 | Tokens: 354 (Overlap)">gnificant pace with electric vehicles. And therefore, fuels are being increasingly exported. On the other side,<br>countries outside of Russia, are processing Russian crude in refineries. And the ban that we see in Europe did not<br>really hold. Therefore, there is also</span><span style="background-color: #FFC6FF;" title="Chunk 15 | Start: 19908 | End: 21600 | Tokens: 373"> competition from Russian products through refineries in India, in Turkey, in<br>Pakistan, etc. This had an impact on the global markets.<br>We also see that, of course, in Europe, some of the refining margins were coming down. 2024 was significantly<br>lower than 2023 [USD 7.1/bbl vs USD 11.7/bbl]. Our expectation according to the outlook that Alfred showed you, is<br>USD 6/bbl incourse, in Europe, some of the refining margins were coming down. 2024 was significantly<br>lower than 2023 [USD 7.1/bbl vs USD 11.7/bbl]. Our expectation according to the outlook that Alfred showed you, is<br>USD 6/bbl in 2025. At the moment, as we speak in Q1 2025, we are even below that.<br>Renewable fuels<br>Question by Michele Della Vigna – Goldman Sachs:<br>It´s been a very volatile, largely disappointing year, I would say, for biofuel margins in the last 12 months. How do you<br>see those evolving? And do you still remain excited about the opportunities for SAF in the years to come?<br>Answer by Alfred Stern:<br>Indeed, we have seen disappointing margin developments last year due to some regulatory changes in some<br>countries and some capacities coming on stream. The FID that we took on our SAF plant [in Petrobr</span><span style="background-color: #a580a5;" title="Chunk 15 | Start: 19908 | End: 21600 | Tokens: 373 (Overlap)">azi] was last<br>year, so we are planning to come into production in 2028.

We<br>initiated arbitration proceedings against Gazprom in the beginning of 2023 for which we received awards, including<br>damage awards, at the end of last year. We then offset these damage awards against open payments for gas<br>supplies in Austria. And as a consequence of this, Gazprom ceased the supply, which was both a contractual and a<br>legal violation, to which we then had to react to and terminated the gas supply contract.<br>As you know in the gas market, being able to count on reliable supplies through long-term gas contracts is a key<br>prerequisite.

I am of the opinion we now have the strongest gas portfolio that we ever had because it&#x27;s<br>diversified across our own production and third-party suppliers through pipelines from Norway, from Italy, and LNG<br>supplies from the U.S., i.e. internationally etc.<br>Gas storage<br>Question by Giacomo Romeo – Jefferies:<br>I think your storage capacity is now close to the level you had at the exit of winter last year. Obviously, wintersummer spreads we&#x27;ve seen do not support injection. What&#x27;s your plan for injection this year on this basis? What is<br>the actual enforcement mechanism in place to make sure that the 90% is reached if the winter summer spreads<br>remain negative?<br>Answer by Alfred Stern:<br>We are currently at about a 65%-67% gas storage level. One year ago it was above 80%. And I think that&#x27;s a result of<br>multiple things. Firstly, the winter this year is colder than it was last year. Or put the other way around, last year was<br>an even more unusually warm winter with less gas demand. And secondly, the  ago it was above 80%. And I think that&#x27;s a result of<br>multiple things. Firstly, the winter this year is cold</span><span style="background-color: #a4a576;" title="Chunk 18 | Start: 24084 | End: 25716 | Tokens: 349 (Overlap)">er than it was last year. Or put the other way around, last year was<br>an even more unusually warm winter with less gas demand. And secondly, the flows through the Ukrainian pipeline<br>to Europe stopped. Those two things have led to a situation where the storage is be</span><span style="background-color: #CAFFBF;" title="Chunk 19 | Start: 25452 | End: 27048 | Tokens: 343">ing depleted. And as you know<br>there are some storage mandates, i.e. minimum filling requirements that we will need to fulfill. And we are currently<br>working on turning this into a good business case. At the moment, the summer-winter spreads are negative and<br>injection is not profitable . It is therefore essential to choose the right timing on refilling the storages to ensure that<br>we have a profitable business.<br>The gas market is very transparent, so the gas storage levels are visible. Additionally, we need to report to the<br>regulator what the storages are. I don&#x27;t think we have seen cases where the mandate was not fulfilled. So I don&#x27;t<br>know what the measure would be then. There are currently discussions in Germany on how to proceed vis-à-vis the<br>market situation.<br>Question by Matthew Lofting – J.P.

We are operating the gas storage business<br>as a profitable business and every investment that we put into storage has a very good return. Therefore you see<br>temporary higher networking capital if the price level goes up, but that comes back. In addition, we have a quite<br>strong swing between high storage levels and low storage levels. I am more concerned about the situation where<br>summer-winter spreads do not provide us with the opportunity for a very good foreseeable business because we<br>are not storing any cubic meters without having them forward sold. If there is no margin, i.e. no spread, we will not<br>forward sell. Currently, we are in a wait-and-see position on how the market develops. However, I am not worried<br>that working capital will become an additional burden because it fluctuates, and whatever we put in as working<br>capital will come out as working capital in the opposite direction during the year.

Does that flow<br>through on a cost or cash flow basis at all if you&#x27;re going out to a market that&#x27;s currently pricing gas at around<br>EUR 50/MWh?<br>Answer by Reinhard Florey:<br>You asked about potential exposure regarding higher costs in the diversified gas portfolio. Our gas supply and<br>trading business is not a cost play, it&#x27;s a margin and arbitrage play. Therefore, when we compare the specific<br>margins and arbitrage that we could do on Russian gas supplies, this is maybe even quite lower than what we see<br>with the diversified gas portfolio that we have at the moment.<br>So this is not determined by individual market prices or by the indices</span>, it is more by the ability to have trading<br>arbitrage and certain supply margins that we have with our customers. And that is not negatively affected. So if the<br>availability of gas volumes is there and therefore we have booked transport capacities, we have booked our terminal<br>in Rotterdam for LNG volumes absolutely full, we are not concerned that there is also a positive result coming from<br>that.<br>Gas &amp; Power Eastern Europe<br>Question by Henry Tarr – Berenberg:<br>What does the gas and power legislation in Romania that you referenced mean going forward for this business?<br>Should we expect it to be sort of loss-making now through 2025?<br>Answer by Reinhard Florey:<br>I can confirm that we are taking all measures in Romania to avoidhat does the gas and power legislation in Romania that you referenced mean going forward for this business?<br>Should we expect it to be sort of loss-making now through 2025?<br>Answer by Reinhard Florey:<br>I can confirm that we are taking all measures in Romania to avoid that this will be a loss- making business. In the<br>past, we have been able to provide a good profitability. Of course, it is being deteriorated by some measures from<br>the Romanian state, which we view as temporary. And the capping specifically of gas prices for households,<br>respectively electricity prices for households, is something that we can counter also with some export activities. So<br>we are currently both on the gas side as well as on the electricity side able to export certain volumes to keep this<br>business profitable. The additional expansion of our electricity production beyond gas into the renewable side will<br>provide a good basis for profitability as those are valued contributions to the electricity market, and would also<br>undergo certain exemptions from legislation. So in total, we are not concerned that this will be a loss-making<br>business.<br>Low Carbon<br>Question by Michele Della Vigna – Goldman Sachs:<br>I wanted to start with geothermal.

That district heating<br>network has about 400,000 households connected to it, and we want to ramp that up to about 200,000 households<br>supplied through geothermal.<br>For this, we have to repeat what we are doing here about 7x in order to get there. So, some development work,<br>some investments are necessary, and we want to make sure we do this step- by-step. The advantage that we have<br>in Vienna is that we have a great joint venture with our partner Wien Energie, that is the district heating network<br>operator and has access to all the households. And because of that setup, I think we have a very good combination. I<br>do not have exactly in mind how much the geothermal contribution will be, Michele, but we are looking by 2030 that<br>about 20% of our cash flows in total will be contributed out of these sustainable projects.<br>D I S C L A I M E R<br>This document contains forward looking statements.
