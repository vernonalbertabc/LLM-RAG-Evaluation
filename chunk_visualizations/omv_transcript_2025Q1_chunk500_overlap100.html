In the first quarter, we have seen more of a mix on the</span><span style="background-color: #FFD6A5;" title="Chunk 17 | Start: 24036 | End: 25680 | Tokens: 345"> lower end of the refineries, which ends up in lower margins. We see that middle distillates are still partly under pressure with the exception of sustainable aviation fuels and overall kerosene. And we are seeing that there is an opportunity on the chemical side that our petrochemical product can also go on further. We are seeing that olefin prices have now in April come down quite -- come up quite significantly around $100 -- and we are also seeing that specifically in polyethylene, we have seen a $50 improvement. So this means that in general, there are market opportunities as well as some risks that we have to balance.<br><br>Regarding the feedstock costs, we still see that the light feedstock advantage that we are having in our Nordic crackers will be slightly lower than what we have seen in the last year, simply because NAFTA will be benefiting from low oil prices, whereas gas prices have been higheedstock costs, we still see that the light feedstock advantage that we are having in our Nordic crackers will be slightly lower than what we have seen in the last year, simply because NAFTA will be benefiting from low oil prices</span><span style="background-color: #a58b6b;" title="Chunk 17 | Start: 24036 | End: 25680 | Tokens: 345 (Overlap)">, whereas gas prices have been higher, at least in the first quarter. We, on the other hand, have also seen that gas prices have come down at the beginning of second quarter. So the effect then remains to be seen. But in general, I do not see only nega</span><span style="background-color: #FDFFB6;" title="Chunk 18 | Start: 25428 | End: 27108 | Tokens: 354">tive developments here. We are also seeing opportunities in the current market.<br><br>Florian Greger<br><br>Thanks a lot, Ram, for your questions. We now come to Alejandro Vigil, Santander.<br><br>Alejandro Vigil<br><br>The first question would be about the ADNOC refining and trading. If you can elaborate about this weak performance you mentioned during the call, if it&#x27;s more driven by trading less opportunities or it&#x27;s more on the refining side?<br><br>And the second question is about -- of course, you have a very strong balance sheet, but you&#x27;re going to increase also leverage with the transaction of Borouge If you are planning some divestments as part of your plan for the coming years to offset this increase in leverage.<br><br>Reinhard Florey<br><br>Yes. Thanks, Alejandro. Maybe I&#x27;ll start with the second question and pass on to for the first question to answer. Regarding the balance sheet and regarding the leverage -- we are still very confident and see a very strong position of OMV. There is no need for us to divest a business as we have already streamlined our portfolio.<br><br>And we are seeing that the additional leverage that we have from the equity injection into BGI will be limite</span><span style="background-color: #a4a576;" title="Chunk 18 | Start: 25428 | End: 27108 | Tokens: 354 (Overlap)">re still very confident and see a very strong position of OMV.

We estimate that even after that, we will only be at a leverage rate slightly above 20%. So therefore, there is nothing that we are considering at the moment in terms of major divestments, although the reasonable rendations of our portfolio are normal course of business that will take on.<br><br>Martijn Arjen van Koten<br><br>Alejandro, this is Martijn. I&#x27;ll then continue on the ADNOC Refining and Trading question. The 2 main effects driving the drop in results ones refining margin in Middle East and Asia that been significantly lower in Q1 this year versus last year. The trading result has also been lower, but it is still strong in our view, Q1 last year was exceptionally good. And so these 2 effects together make for a tough first quarter. I&#x27;ll go be finding that the team there is very focused, of course, in this difficult and volatile environment to make the best the trading opportunities, but the refining margin also now in Q2 in the Middle East, it looks very challenging.<br><br>That&#x27;s, of course, driven by a combination of economic uncertainty bu</span><span style="background-color: #83a57c;" title="Chunk 19 | Start: 26844 | End: 28536 | Tokens: 358 (Overlap)">t it&#x27;s also driven by a change in the availability of lighter and heavier crudes.

We now come to Henry Tarr.<br><br>Henry Tarr<br><br>I guess the main one is really around the Borouge Group International and the floor dividend. So how robust do you think this is the sort of changes in the macro environment given leverage targets, et cetera, for the combined group? Or I guess another way to ask it would be, what would have to happen for the floor dividend to become a risk at this point?<br><br>Reinhard Florey<br><br>Yes, Henry, thanks for the question. And I appreciate that the floor dividend is really an attraction for PGI and PI investors among the OMV. Indeed, the floor dividend is adjusted to the business plans that we see ahead even in more riskier scenarios. We do not see that the floor dividend is at risk with the perspective that we have today. The beauty of BGI actually is that it&#x27;s a global business and that, </span><span style="background-color: #649fa5;" title="Chunk 20 | Start: 28284 | End: 29916 | Tokens: 365 (Overlap)">in general, the presence on the local markets of U.S., of Asia, Middle East and Europe can be played alongside their strength, which means European production for European demand when it comes to specialties, when it comes to high-end plastics where we</span><span style="background-color: #A0C4FF;" title="Chunk 21 | Start: 29664 | End: 31296 | Tokens: 376"> have an upgrade of the current product portfolio in the U.S. through the new technologies but also in Middle East, when Borouge will come on, we will see that there is a significant addition of both capacity and qualities that gh-end plastics where we have an upgrade of the current product portfolio in the U.S. through the new technologies but also in Middle East, when Borouge will come on, we will see that there is a significant addition of both capacity and qualities that can be produced with the latest postal technology there.<br><br>And we&#x27;re also seeing that the current situation in a tariff scenario would not be adverse to this setup because specifically, we see that Middle East currently is not affected by tariffs and also the export from Borouge into the Chinese markets and other Asian markets are not negatively affected. So therefore, we feel that the floor dividend in the business plan that we have, including risk scenarios is not something that we are currently concerned about.<br><br>Florian Greger<br><br>I was just notified that the next in line dropped. I know it&#x27;s a very busy reporting day. Currently, there is no other peopl</span><span style="background-color: #687fa5;" title="Chunk 21 | Start: 29664 | End: 31296 | Tokens: 376 (Overlap)">e in the line asking questions. So if you have a follow-up question, you I just hear that there is a follow-up from Josh.<br><br>Josh Stone<br><br>I thought I&#x27;d keep going. On to about tariffs, you mentioned no direct impact or very minimal impact on O</span><span style="background-color: #BDB2FF;" title="Chunk 22 | Start: 31056 | End: 32616 | Tokens: 360">MV. Can you maybe just expand on Nova Chemicals and going through the scenarios on that, given they have both U.S. and Canadian assets, it&#x27;s quite difficult for us to understand what potential impact that might be? And I&#x27;m sure you did a lot of audit on that. So maybe you could just talk about that, that would be helpful.<br><br>Reinhard Florey<br><br>Indeed, in a general note, the exposure to tariffs as we see it in the narrow sense will be marginal to OMV. The reason simply is that with our supply radius that we have, both on the upaybe you could just talk about that, that would be helpful.<br><br>Reinhard Florey<br><br>Indeed, in a general note, the exposure to tariffs as we see it in the narrow sense will be marginal to OMV.

On the other hand, when it comes to we are seeing that this global individual setup as such, will rather help to avoid being exposed to tariffs.<br><br>Now of course, I u</span><span style="background-color: #7a73a5;" title="Chunk 22 | Start: 31056 | End: 32616 | Tokens: 360 (Overlap)">nderstand that you are addressing the topic between Canada and U.S., and we have analyzed that in both the due diligence as well as in the discussions with Nova quite significantly.

We are </span><span style="background-color: #FFC6FF;" title="Chunk 23 | Start: 32364 | End: 34020 | Tokens: 341">not seeing that the products or polyolefins are being affected between Canada and U.S.<br><br>And we are also not seeing that this would be a reasonable measure from the U.S. to take against Canada or vice versa because this is so much interlinked trade, and there are quite some dependencies of industry branches in the U.S. on the Canadian production.

The first </span><span style="background-color: #a580a5;" title="Chunk 23 | Start: 32364 | End: 34020 | Tokens: 341 (Overlap)">1 was on the current refining market. You&#x27;ve maintained the $6 per barrel than you have highlighted margins being very volatile. I was just wondering what the current levels were that you&#x27;re seeing right now? What has it what have they been more recently. But also</span><span style="background-color: #FFADAD;" title="Chunk 24 | Start: 33756 | End: 35388 | Tokens: 344"> I appreciate if you could provide some color on whether you&#x27;re seeing any basic changes on demand over the past 1 month, I suppose, how do you look into the demand when you look into 2025, especially the 1 from a distillate.<br><br>The second 1 was related to the dividends the dividends to the minority shareholders. I was just wondering what your -- what is your guidance for the dividends you put your minority shareholders for 2025.<br><br>Reinhard Florey<br><br>Okay. Thanks, Maybe I would ask more time to start with the first question.<br><br>Martijn Arjen van Koten<br><br>Thank you, for the question. On the refining market, the unfortunately that April is slightly better than the average of the first quarter. So average first quarter $6.7-ish and now $6.4. So it remains a tough environment in the Middle East. It&#x27;s the same actually also a lower start in Q2 than in the average of Q1.<br><br>Now what you have to keep in mind is that, especially in Europe, there&#x27;s also, of course, inland margins -- and they are also volatile already since Q4 last year. There&#x27;s different dynamics playing there we see in general, that Jet is doing very </span><span style="background-color: #a57070;" title="Chunk 24 | Start: 33756 | End: 35388 | Tokens: 344 (Overlap)">well. We alsat you have to keep in mind is that, especially in Europe, there&#x27;s also, of course, inland margins -- and they are also volatile already since Q4 last year. There&#x27;s different dynamics playing there we see in general, that Jet is doing very </span><span style="background-color: #FFD6A5;" title="Chunk 25 | Start: 35136 | End: 36307 | Tokens: 252">well. We also see that the consumers on retail kind of are holding up, but we see some weakness in the business segments. And it&#x27;s similar to what Reinhard described on polyolefins. So it&#x27;s a different picture on the Energy segment.<br><br>Reinhard Florey<br><br>And to your second question regarding dividends from we are currently seeing a shareholding of 75% of tales for OMV and 25% from ADNOC. So the minority shareholder, as you call it, is actually ADNOC. And what we see is that, of course, you see a certain negative cash impact fully consolidated goals in our balance sheet if there is outflow on this 25% when we will receive the dividend.<br><br>On the other hand, the opposite is the case in Borouge and in the total dividend that we see receiving from Doug and trading out to ADNOC from Borealis -- this is a positive sale for OMV. And that is why I indicated that this equalization payment and capital injection into BGI, </span>which is anticipated as EUR 1.6 billion will be probably lower at around EUR 1.5 billion after the dividend payouts because that will be adjusted according to the dividends that will flow from both Borealis and Borouge.<br><br>Florian Greger<br><br>We now move on to Bertrand Hodee.<br><br>Bertrand Hodee<br><br>Yes. I just have one. So obviously, macro is uncertain, but oil price is still relatively healthy at above $60. We have a lot of uncertainties around future OpEx policy -- and you&#x27;ve keer<br><br>We now move on to Bertrand Hodee.<br><br>Bertrand Hodee<br><br>Yes. I just have one. So obviously, macro is uncertain, but oil price is still relatively healthy at above $60. We have a lot of uncertainties around future OpEx policy -- and you&#x27;ve kept your 2025 CapEx and change for now. But what is the plan B is if we have a very severe oil price downturn, let&#x27;s say, toward $40 per barrel. So yes, I wanted to understand how you can flex your CapEx in I would say, a stringent.<br><br>Reinhard Florey<br><br>Yes. Thanks, Of course, we see a $40 scenario currently is not very likely and we are seeing it more as a remote scenario. Nevertheless, of course, also our company runs risk scenarios, and we run the kind of response possibilities and making sure that we have resilience plans. While this is nothing that we can communicate in any detail, I can assure you that we have 3 levers that we will definitely play on. The first is we are working very intensely on our operating cost optimization and efficiencies which will help us to respond.<br><br>The second is, we see flexibility on CapEx, of course, and as you may remember, in 2020, when COVID crisis was hitting the market and oil prices dropped sharply into the direction of $40. We were able to cap our CapEx within this 1 year by more than 30%. So you can see that a company does have this kind of responsiveness as well as this kind of resilience.<br><br>And then, of course, it&#x27;s net working capital. Net working capital is a little bit of a buffer factor that we have when oil prices and margins would come down. So you woulmpany does have this kind of responsiveness as well as this kind of resilience.<br><br>And then, of course, it&#x27;s net working capital. Net working capital is a little bit of a buffer factor that we have when oil prices and margins would come down. So you would see that immediately also the level of net working capital dropping and releasing some of that net working capital into cash, providing a certain reserve and security for the balance sheet but we also have these kind of active responses in our plants. And this is, of course, something we are considering that we are rather currently seeing the span between $60 and $70 with the full year more towards the $70 still then thinking about the $40 of oil price environment as of yet.<br><br>Florian Greger<br><br>We now come to Matt Smith, Bank of America.<br><br>Matt Smith<br><br>Two questions from me, please. The first is just a clarification on the Borouge Group International floor dividend, and that was just a simple clarification whether the full dividend or at least to OMV was the -- whether it was 90% of net income, whether that represents the floor or whether it was the EUR 2.2 billion total amount that translated to USD 1 billion to OMV. So that was a simple clarification on the BGI dividend?<br><br>And then secondly, I wanted to come on to the chemicals margins not sort of current and certain environment actually thrown up some opportunities. And I think you noted some improvements in some chemical spreads in April, but just wanted to I wondered if you could touch on some of the drivers there, please understand those opportunities. What do you think is driving that and therefore, help us think about the sustahink you noted some improvements in some chemical spreads in April, but just wanted to I wondered if you could touch on some of the drivers there, please understand those opportunities. What do you think is driving that and therefore, help us think about the sustainability of that, please?<br><br>Reinhard Florey<br><br>Yes. Thanks, Matt. Regarding the floor dividend, just to explain in some more detail. The floor dividend for the whole group of PTI is around USD 2.2 billion. Then according to the current situation, OMV would be entitled a share of 46.9% after the anticipated capital increase, this will rather be a share of around 43%. This will then translate into around USD 1 billion or according to the exchange rate around EUR 900 million. That is a net cash inflow to OMV.<br><br>And whenever you see the consolidation, you would see more or less the operating cash flow being the net cash flow and the net cash flow being the dividend. That is how the nonconsolidated or equity consolidated method that we will have then the BGI group, including in this transaction.<br><br>So you would see as an operating cash flow, the EUR 900 million and as a free cash flow also the EUR 900 million. In Chemicals margins regarding opportunities, whenever we see the possibilities to shift the portfolio towards higher grading that always unlocks an opportunity for higher margins. Currently, we have seen in Q1, rather a decline of our share on the specialties. This is something we aim to reverse for the rest of the year to come back to a quite high share of specialties.<br><br>And if we see a certain recovery of the economy, and also a positive pricing ofen in Q1, rather a decline of our share on the specialties. This is something we aim to reverse for the rest of the year to come back to a quite high share of specialties.<br><br>And if we see a certain recovery of the economy, and also a positive pricing of the pre-materials of the feedstock for chemicals. This enables them also a margin uplift that we could realize in the market.<br><br>Martijn Arjen van Koten<br><br>Matt, maybe -- this is Martijn, just a few extra words because I think what&#x27;s also good is the resilience that we have. So next to the opportunities that Ryan talked about. We, of course, integrated business model and what we see as the refining margins are weak right at getting lower and especially then for the trackers that we have in Central Europe, in Austria and Germany, we see that the margin then expense. That also gives us certain that integrated model is in resilience. And the same holds true for the.<br><br>Florian Greger<br><br>We now are at the end of our conference call and would like to thank you for joining us today. Should you have any further questions, please contact the Investor Relations team. We will be happy to help. Goodbye, and have a nice day.</div>
